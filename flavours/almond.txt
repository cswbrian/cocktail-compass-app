While it doesn't actually contain Dr. Pepper soda in its construction, its flavor profile aims to mimic the popular soft drink through a combination of amaretto and high-proof rum. The drink is ignited, creating a visually striking effect before being extinguished and consumed. Due to the use of flammable liquids and fire, this cocktail should only be prepared and consumed by experienced individuals in a controlled setting, taking all necessary safety precautions. The drink became popular in some bars and pubs, often as a showy, ordered dare. Its creation and popularization are more a product of bar culture and the pursuit of unusual drink experiences rather than a carefully crafted historical recipe. The high-proof rum provides the fuel for the flame, while the amaretto offers the base flavor, the entire drink must be done with extreme caution and with knowledge of dealing with open flame near flammable liquid.","historical_reference":"Source not found","technique":"1. Pour the beer into a heat-resistant glass, leaving about an inch of space at the top. 2. In a separate heat-resistant shot glass, carefully layer the amaretto. 3. Float the high-proof rum on top of the amaretto in the shot glass. 4. Carefully ignite the rum in the shot glass using a long lighter or match. 5. Allow the flame to burn for a few seconds (no more than 5-10 seconds). 6. Extinguish the flame by dropping the shot glass into the beer-filled glass, be careful to use a bar spoon to avoid splashing. 7. Consume immediately and responsibly.","garnish":"None recommended due to the nature of the drink.
