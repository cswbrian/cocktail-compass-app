f:T400,The Sea Breeze is a classic highball cocktail known for its simplicity and refreshing taste. It's a variation of the Cape Codder (vodka and cranberry juice), with the addition of grapefruit juice, resulting in a slightly tart and more complex flavor profile. The Sea Breeze gained popularity in the mid-20th century as vodka became increasingly prevalent in American cocktail culture. Its appeal lies in its ease of preparation and its light, crisp character, making it a perfect choice for warm weather or casual gatherings. The combination of cranberry and grapefruit juice offers a balance of sweet and sour notes, while the vodka provides the necessary alcoholic kick. It is easy to customize and is a base to many similar cocktails. The simplicity of the ingredients allows for easy modifications, such as using different types of juice or adding other spirits to create unique variations. Its vibrant color and refreshing taste make it a visually appealing and enjoyable drink, contributing to its enduring popularity.10:T431,The Greyhound is a simple and refreshing cocktail consisting of vodka and grapefruit juice. Its origins are somewhat murky, with some suggesting it originated in the 1930s. The name 'Greyhound' is believed to be derived from the Greyhound bus lines, as the drink was often served in bus terminals and diners along the bus routes. Its simplicity has made it a popular choice over the decades, appreciated for its ease of preparation and thirst-quenching qualities. It’s a staple on many bar menus due to its straightforward appeal. The cocktail remains a classic choice for those who prefer a tart and subtly sweet beverage without overwhelming complexity. There are many variations. Adding a salted rim transforms it into a Salty Dog, but the core combination of vodka and grapefruit remains the same for the basic Greyhound. The grapefruit can vary from white to pink. The choice of vodka is very personal, as it can change the flavor profile quite a bit. Cheaper vodkas will have a rubbing alcohol taste to them while the higher end vodkas will have very little flavor.11:T49f,The Vargtass, meaning 'Wolf's Paw' in Swedish, is a simple yet potent cocktail that embodies the spirit of the Nordic wilderness. Its straightforward composition of vodka and lingonberry concentrate makes it a popular choice in Sweden, particularly during colder months. The drink is known for its tart and slightly sweet flavor profile, offering a refreshing contrast to the often harsh winter climate. While its exact origins are somewhat obscure, the Vargtass is thought to have emerged as a convenient and accessible way to enjoy local berries in a more palatable form, especially when fresh berries are scarce. It represents a pragmatic approach to cocktail making, prioritizing readily available ingredients and ease of preparation. The Vargtass is often enjoyed as an apéritif or a social drink, reflecting the Swedish tradition of 'fika' – taking a break to enjoy coffee and a small treat with friends or colleagues. The combination of vodka and lingonberries delivers a balanced experience, making it a comforting and invigorating beverage. Today, the Vargtass remains a staple in many Swedish homes and bars, a testament to its enduring appeal and cultural significance.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Tart"," flavor"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Le","Sea Breeze",{"cocktail":{"name":"Sea Breeze","description":"$f","historical_reference":"Difford's Guide, accessed October 26, 2023.
