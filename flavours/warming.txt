Historically, it was consumed in the morning, serving as a sort of eye-opener and morale booster. The precise origins are somewhat murky, but it is believed to have been a common practice among soldiers during various conflicts, including the World Wars. The combination of coffee and rum offered both a caffeine kick and a warming effect, making it a practical and comforting drink in challenging conditions. While the Gunfire is most strongly linked to military contexts, it has also found its way into civilian life as a warming winter beverage, especially in regions with cold climates. The drink's simplicity and effectiveness have ensured its continued popularity, maintaining its reputation as a no-nonsense drink with a historical edge. The drink is best served hot and consumed immediately to fully appreciate its comforting qualities.","historical_reference":"Attested in anecdotal sources related to British military traditions, particularly during the World Wars. The drink's association with 'gunfire' is symbolic of a morning wake-up call or a quick, potent boost before action.
