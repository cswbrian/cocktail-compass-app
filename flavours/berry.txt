10:T519,The Kir Royale is a variation of the classic Kir cocktail, which is simply white wine topped with crème de cassis (blackcurrant liqueur). The 'Royale' element indicates the use of champagne instead of white wine, elevating the drink into a celebratory and luxurious cocktail. The Kir Royale became popular in the mid-20th century, particularly in France, and has since gained international recognition as an elegant and easy-to-make aperitif. It's often served at weddings, parties, and other special occasions. While the classic recipe calls for crème de cassis, other fruit liqueurs like raspberry (crème de framboise) or peach (crème de pêche) can be used to create variations. The Kir Royale is appreciated for its simplicity, delightful color, and refreshing taste, making it a perfect welcome drink or a light cocktail to enjoy any time of year. The drink's appealing color and effervescence contribute to its widespread appeal. Its subtle sweetness and fruity notes make it a crowd-pleaser, suitable for those who prefer lighter and less boozy cocktails. The cocktail is named after Félix Kir, a mayor of Dijon in Burgundy, France, who popularized the drink after World War II. He used the drink as a way to promote regional products, namely Burgundy Aligoté white wine and crème de cassis.7:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Berry"," flavor"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Lf","Kir Royale",{"cocktail":{"name":"Kir Royale","description":"$10","historical_reference":"While a precise historical citation is elusive, the Kir Royale's origin is reliably traced to Félix Kir's efforts in post-WWII Dijon, France.
