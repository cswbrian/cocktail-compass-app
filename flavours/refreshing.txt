f:T492,The Southside is a classic gin-based cocktail that bears a striking resemblance to a Mojito, but with gin taking the place of rum. Its origins are debated, but it's often associated with the South Side of Chicago during the Prohibition era. Legend has it that Al Capone's gang favored gin, which was easier to produce illicitly and hence more readily available on the South Side, while rival gangs on the North Side preferred whiskey. The Southside offered a refreshing way to mask the often-rough taste of bathtub gin. The drink's combination of gin, mint, lime, and sugar makes it a light, crisp, and invigorating choice, especially popular during warmer months. Over time, variations have emerged, some calling for the addition of egg white to create a richer, silkier texture, known as the Southside Fizz when topped with soda water. The drink's enduring appeal stems from its simplicity, balance, and refreshing character, making it a favorite among gin enthusiasts and a testament to the creativity born out of necessity during Prohibition. The Southside is more than just a drink; it is a piece of American history, a symbol of resilience, and a delicious escape.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Refreshing"," flavor"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Le","Moscow Mule",{"cocktail":{"name":"Moscow Mule","description":"The Moscow Mule is a classic cocktail known for its refreshing and spicy flavor profile.

Facing difficulties in selling their Smirnoff vodka and ginger beer respectively, they combined the two ingredients and added a squeeze of lime. The copper mug was introduced to further enhance the drink's appeal. The Moscow Mule quickly became a sensation, especially in Hollywood, and helped popularize vodka in the United States.

Its exact origins are somewhat debated, but one popular story attributes it to a waiter named John Collins, who worked at Limmer's Old House in London. Originally, the cocktail was made with Old Tom Gin, a slightly sweeter style of gin. Over time, London Dry Gin became the more common choice. The John Collins is essentially a gin sour lengthened with carbonated water, making it a refreshing and effervescent drink, perfect for warm weather. It belongs to the Collins family of cocktails, which are distinguished by their use of a base spirit, lemon juice, sugar, and carbonated water, served in a tall glass over ice. Variations exist using other base spirits, resulting in drinks like the Tom Collins (gin), the Vodka Collins (vodka), and the Rum Collins (rum). The drink gained significant popularity during the late 19th and early 20th centuries and continues to be a beloved classic in bars around the world.","historical_reference":"Harry Johnson's Bartenders' Manual (1882) details a recipe for John Collins, indicating its prominence in the late 19th century.
