10:T454,The Porn Star Martini, created in 2002 by Douglas Ankrah at LAB Bar in London, is a modern classic known for its vibrant flavors and theatrical presentation. Ankrah aimed to create a drink that was both sexy and fun, reflected in its name and the ritualistic serving of a shot of Prosecco alongside the cocktail. The drink's popularity quickly spread, making it a staple in bars worldwide. The combination of vanilla vodka, passion fruit puree, passion fruit liqueur, and a hint of lime offers a balance of sweet, sour, and tropical notes. The accompanying Prosecco shot is intended to be sipped before the cocktail to cleanse the palate or after, to complement and enhance the overall experience. Its widespread appeal lies in its refreshing taste, visually appealing presentation, and the playful indulgence it represents, making it a favorite for celebratory occasions and a symbol of contemporary cocktail culture. The cocktail embodies a modern approach to mixology by building a multi-sensory experience, it is meant to evoke a feeling of luxury and excitement, contributing to its enduring popularity.7:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Vanilla Liqueur"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Lf","Porn Star Martini",{"cocktail":{"name":"Porn Star Martini","description":"$10","historical_reference":"First created in 2002 by Douglas Ankrah at LAB Bar in London.","technique":"1.
