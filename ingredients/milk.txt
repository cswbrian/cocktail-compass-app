f:T43d,Hoppelpoppel, also spelled Hoppel poppel, is a traditional German and Austrian drink, often served warm. It's essentially a boozy, custardy concoction that's perfect for colder weather or as a comforting dessert beverage. The exact origins are somewhat hazy, like many traditional drinks passed down through generations. The base usually involves eggs, milk or cream, sugar, and a spirit such as rum or genever, or even brandy. Recipes vary from family to family, region to region, with personal preferences dictating the final outcome. Some versions include spices like cinnamon or nutmeg for added warmth and complexity. Think of it as a cross between eggnog and a hot toddy, adapted to use readily available ingredients and local tastes of Central Europe. It's more commonly homemade than commercially produced, embodying the spirit of cozy, home-spun hospitality. The rich, creamy texture and the warming alcoholic kick make it a delightful and satisfying beverage, particularly during the winter months or festive occasions. It is often enjoyed after a meal or as a special treat.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Milk"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Le","Cement Mixer",{"cocktail":{"name":"Cement Mixer","description":"The Cement Mixer is a novelty shot known for its unpleasant taste and texture.
