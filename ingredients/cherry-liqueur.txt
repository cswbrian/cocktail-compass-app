10:T47d,The Singapore Sling is a complex and iconic cocktail originating from the Raffles Hotel in Singapore. Created around 1915 by bartender Ngiam Tong Boon, it was initially conceived as a gin-based drink for women, offering a socially acceptable way for them to consume alcohol in public. The original recipe was a closely guarded secret, leading to numerous variations over the years. The Sling's popularity quickly spread, becoming a symbol of Singapore's colonial charm and a must-try for visitors. Its appeal lies in its balanced blend of sweet, sour, and fruity flavors, complemented by the subtle complexity of gin and liqueurs. The modern interpretations often include cherry brandy, Cointreau, and Benedictine, contributing to its distinctive taste and vibrant pink hue. Today, the Singapore Sling remains a beloved classic, celebrated for its rich history and refreshing character, embodying the spirit of its birthplace. Despite variations, the core elements of gin, cherry liqueur, and tropical fruit flavors endure, ensuring its timeless appeal. The drink is designed to be a balanced and refreshing combination of gin, fruit, and sweetness.7:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Cherry Liqueur"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Lf","Singapore Sling",{"cocktail":{"name":"Singapore Sling","description":"$10","historical_reference":"The Singapore Sling was created by bartender Ngiam Tong Boon at the Raffles Hotel in Singapore around 1915. - https://www.raffles.com/singapore/raffles-history/#:~:text=The%20Raffles%20Hotel%20Singapore%20is,by%20bartender%20Ngiam%20Tong%20Boon.
