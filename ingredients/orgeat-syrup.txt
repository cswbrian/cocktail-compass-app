10:T4f6,The Mai Tai is a quintessential tiki cocktail, born in 1944 at Trader Vic's in Oakland, California. Victor Bergeron, aka Trader Vic, created the drink for some Tahitian friends, who exclaimed "Maita'i roa a'e!" which translates to "Out of this world! – the best!" in Tahitian. The original recipe focused on showcasing the flavor of high-quality Jamaican rum, complemented by orgeat syrup, lime juice, curaçao, and simple syrup. Over time, variations emerged, often incorporating other fruit juices like pineapple and orange, which deviate from the original intent. This cocktail is all about balancing the sweetness of the syrups with the tartness of the lime and the robust character of the rums. The interplay of flavors creates a tropical escape in a glass. While its history is relatively modern compared to other classics, the Mai Tai has become an iconic symbol of tiki culture, representing relaxation, exoticism, and escapism. The drink's popularity soared in the mid-20th century, fueled by the rise of Polynesian-themed restaurants and bars. Today, it remains a beloved cocktail, though often misinterpreted and over-sweetened. A well-made Mai Tai should highlight the rum, creating a harmonious blend of flavors that transports you to a tropical paradise.11:T464,The Flaming Volcano is a potent and visually stunning tiki cocktail, typically served in a communal bowl designed to resemble a volcano. Its origins are often attributed to tiki bars of the mid-20th century, like Don the Beachcomber or Trader Vic's, although a definitive origin story remains elusive. The drink is characterized by its blend of multiple rums, brandy, and tropical fruit juices, resulting in a sweet, strong, and complex flavor profile. The 'flaming' aspect is achieved by soaking a sugar cube in high-proof alcohol and setting it alight, creating a dramatic and theatrical presentation. This cocktail is meant for sharing and embodies the spirit of tiki culture: exotic flavors, strong spirits, and a sense of convivial celebration. It's often served with long straws, encouraging guests to partake together in this fiery concoction. The flaming element is a key part of the experience, adding warmth and visual appeal, while the combination of sweet and strong elements makes it a memorable and potent drink. The Flaming Volcano exemplifies the escapism and adventure that tiki cocktails sought to provide.7:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Orgeat Syrup"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Lf","Mai Tai",{"cocktail":{"name":"Mai Tai","description":"$10","historical_reference":"Trader Vic's Bartender's Guide, Revised Edition, Doubleday, 1972. p. 240.","technique":"Add all ingredients to a shaker with ice.
