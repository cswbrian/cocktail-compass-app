10:T465,The Penicillin is a modern classic cocktail created in 2005 by Sam Ross at Milk & Honey in New York City. It's a variation on the Gold Rush, a whiskey sour made with honey syrup. Ross's Penicillin distinguishes itself by adding ginger and a float of smoky Islay Scotch. The cocktail is a delightful balance of sweet, sour, and spicy flavors, with a pronounced smoky aroma. The ginger adds a warm, spicy kick that complements the honey's sweetness, while the lemon juice provides a refreshing tartness. The Islay Scotch, typically Laphroaig, adds a layer of complexity with its distinctive peaty and medicinal notes. The Penicillin quickly gained popularity for its innovative flavor combination and has become a staple in many cocktail bars worldwide. It is often cited as one of the most influential cocktails of the 21st century. The drink's name suggests its supposed medicinal properties, hinting at the soothing qualities of honey, ginger, and whisky, though it is mostly a playful reference. It's a sophisticated and balanced cocktail suitable for both whisky enthusiasts and those looking for a more adventurous drink.7:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Blended Scotch Whisky"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Lf","Islay Mist",{"cocktail":{"name":"Islay Mist","description":"The Islay Mist cocktail is a simple and refreshing drink designed to highlight the unique character of Islay Mist blended Scotch whisky.

This cocktail typically features a mix of Scotch, lemon juice, and sugar or honey, creating a balance of smoky, sweet, and sour flavors. The Islay Mist is typically served over ice and garnished with a lemon twist. The precise origins of the Islay Mist cocktail are somewhat hazy, but it's likely a more modern creation designed to showcase the blended whisky of the same name.
