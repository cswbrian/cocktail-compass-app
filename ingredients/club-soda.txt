Its origins are somewhat murky, with several stories vying for its creation. One popular narrative traces the drink back to a London head waiter named John Collins, working in the 1820s at Limmer's Hotel. It's said that he crafted a refreshing gin punch that became a favorite among patrons and was later named after him. Another anecdote attributes the drink's creation to a bartender of the same name, who worked at a hotel in New York in the 1870s. Whatever its true origins, the Tom Collins gained immense popularity in the late 19th century and has remained a beloved classic ever since. The drink became incredibly popular in 1874 when it was mentioned in a hoax that spread across New York, blaming a 'Tom Collins' for spreading malicious rumours.","historical_reference":"The earliest recipes for a 'John Collins' appeared in the 1869 Steward and Barkeeper's Manual by Harry Johnson. The use of Old Tom Gin became standard, leading to the name 'Tom Collins'. (1869)","technique":"In a Collins glass filled with ice, combine gin, lemon juice, and simple syrup. Stir well to combine.
