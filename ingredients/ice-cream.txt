Its resemblance to a chocolate milkshake makes it dangerously easy to drink. Legend has it that the drink was created in 1975 at the Sandshaker Bar on Pensacola Beach, Florida, although some claim its origins lie elsewhere in the Caribbean. Regardless of its exact birthplace, the Bushwacker has become a beloved vacation staple, especially in beachside bars and resorts. Its popularity stems from its blend of rum, coffee liqueur, chocolate liqueur, and ice cream, creating a smooth, sweet, and boozy treat. Variations abound, with some recipes calling for additional liqueurs or spices to further customize the flavor. The Bushwacker is often served blended with ice, resulting in a frozen concoction perfect for cooling down on a hot day. It's a reminder of tropical getaways and carefree relaxation, embodying the spirit of island life.","historical_reference":"Pensacola News Journal, August 13, 1975: Article referencing the Bushwacker cocktail being served at the Sandshaker Lounge in Pensacola Beach, Florida.","technique":"Combine all ingredients in a blender.
