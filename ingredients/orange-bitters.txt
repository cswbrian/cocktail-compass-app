10:T4cc,The Blackthorn is a classic cocktail, essentially a variation on the Manhattan or Rob Roy, using Irish whiskey instead of rye or Scotch, and French vermouth in place of sweet vermouth. It is a simple yet elegant drink with a slightly drier profile than its more famous cousins, often featuring a dash of absinthe or aromatic bitters for added complexity. The Blackthorn offers a delightful combination of the Irish whiskey's warmth, the vermouth's herbal and slightly bitter notes, and the subtle anise flavor from the absinthe, resulting in a balanced and sophisticated cocktail. It is believed to have originated sometime in the late 19th or early 20th century, and like many classic cocktails, its exact origins are debated. It has been featured in many cocktail books throughout history, showing its wide appeal and resilience as a classic drink. While its specific origins are not definitively known, the drink reflects a period of cocktail experimentation where bartenders adapted classic formulas with regional ingredients to create unique variations. Over time, different bartenders have refined the recipe, incorporating elements such as aromatic bitters or orange bitters to enhance the drink's overall flavor profile.11:T484,The Lorraine cocktail, a relatively obscure classic, offers a delightful balance of dry gin, vermouth, and maraschino liqueur. Its precise origins remain somewhat hazy, adding to its mystique. While not as widely known as other gin-based cocktails like the Martini or Negroni, the Lorraine provides a sophisticated and nuanced drinking experience. The combination of dry gin and dry vermouth creates a crisp, slightly herbaceous base, while the maraschino liqueur lends a subtle sweetness and cherry notes. A dash of orange bitters adds further complexity and aromatic dimension. The Lorraine is typically served straight up in a chilled coupe or martini glass, allowing its delicate flavors to shine. It is a sophisticated choice for those seeking a gin-forward cocktail with a touch of sweetness and complexity. The proportions may vary slightly depending on the recipe source, but the core ingredients remain consistent. The Lorraine presents a refreshing alternative to more common cocktails, making it an intriguing choice for adventurous palates. Its understated elegance and balanced profile make it suitable as an aperitif or an after-dinner drink.12:T425,The Bijou cocktail, translating to 'jewel' in French, is a classic drink created in the late 19th century by Harry Johnson, a renowned bartender of the era. It's named for the three colors of its ingredients, which represent gemstones: gin for diamond (clear), sweet vermouth for ruby (red), and green Chartreuse for emerald (green). The Bijou is a spirit-forward cocktail, balancing the herbal and botanical notes of gin with the sweet and spicy character of vermouth and the complex herbal and slightly sweet taste of green Chartreuse. Orange bitters contribute a citrusy aroma and a touch of bitterness, further enhancing the drink's complexity. The result is a sophisticated and harmonious blend of flavors, showcasing the interplay of complementary ingredients. It's a great alternative to a Negroni if you want something a little less bitter. The Bijou remains a testament to the art of cocktail creation, reflecting the historical context of its origin and continuing to be appreciated by cocktail enthusiasts seeking a balanced and flavorful experience.13:T426,The Old Etonian cocktail is a classic concoction with a complex and layered flavor profile, offering a delightful balance of sweet, bitter, and herbal notes. Its roots are somewhat obscure, lacking a definitive historical origin, but it is known from the mid-20th century bartending guides. The drink combines the dryness of gin with the herbal and slightly bitter character of Lillet Blanc and the sweetness from the apricot brandy and orange bitters, resulting in a sophisticated and balanced drink. The cocktail's name suggests a connection to Eton College, a prestigious boarding school in England, implying an association with refined tastes and a sense of tradition. The Old Etonian provides a smooth and elegant drinking experience, often served in a chilled cocktail glass without ice, thus highlighting the cocktail's rich flavors. It appeals to those who appreciate well-balanced cocktails with a subtle sweetness and interesting herbal undertones. It is a drink to be savored slowly, allowing one to appreciate the interplay of its diverse components.14:T57d,The Bamboo cocktail is a classic aperitif known for its elegant simplicity and relatively low alcohol content. Created in the late 19th century at the Grand Hotel in Yokohama, Japan, by a bartender named Louis Eppinger, it was designed to cater to the tastes of international travelers seeking a lighter drink. The Bamboo is essentially a sherry-based Martini, substituting gin or vodka with dry sherry. This substitution results in a gentler, more nuanced flavor profile, making it an excellent choice for those who prefer a less intense cocktail. The drink's popularity spread through word of mouth and early cocktail books, solidifying its place in cocktail history as a sophisticated and approachable option. Its appeal lies in its balanced composition, showcasing the interplay between the nutty notes of sherry and the herbal undertones of vermouth, all lifted by a touch of bitters. The Bamboo remains a favorite among cocktail enthusiasts who appreciate a refined and subtle drinking experience, and it embodies a bridge between European cocktail traditions and the emerging global cocktail culture of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Variations exist using different types of sherry and vermouth to adjust the drink's flavor profile, but the core concept remains the same: a harmonious blend of sherry and vermouth, creating a lighter, more elegant alternative to spirit-forward cocktails.15:T4e6,The Tuxedo cocktail, a refined and sophisticated variation on the classic Martini, emerged in the late 19th century. Its precise origins are somewhat debated, with some attributing it to the Tuxedo Club in New York City, while others suggest it was created at a bar of the same name. What sets the Tuxedo apart from a standard Martini is the addition of maraschino liqueur, absinthe, and orange bitters, creating a more complex and aromatic experience. These additions mellow the gin's intensity, introducing subtle sweetness, herbal notes, and citrus aromas. The Tuxedo offers a journey beyond the stark dryness of a Martini, appealing to those seeking a more nuanced and flavorful cocktail. It represents a step towards elegance, offering subtle complexity, yet it remains dry enough to be an aperitif. The Tuxedo has several variations. The Tuxedo No. 2, for example, uses dry vermouth, orange bitters, absinthe, and maraschino. The original recipe (Tuxedo No. 1) called for sherry, but the modern versions often replace it with vermouth, either dry or sweet, depending on the preference. The Tuxedo remains a testament to the innovation in classic cocktail recipes, showcasing how a simple addition or substitution can transform the whole experience.7:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Orange Bitters"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Lf","Blackthorn",{"cocktail":{"name":"Blackthorn","description":"$10","historical_reference":"A version of the recipe appears in Harry Johnson's 'Bartenders' Manual' (1882).","technique":"Chill a coupe or martini glass.

The addition of orange bitters further enhances the citrus character. The technique is simple, involving stirring the ingredients with ice to chill and dilute, resulting in a smooth, balanced drink.

The drink gained popularity through its promotion by Parisian bartenders who aimed to appeal to American tourists seeking a taste of rebellion. Its blend of rye whiskey, dry vermouth, lemon juice, grenadine, and orange bitters creates a balance of sweet, sour, and spicy flavors, making it a complex and intriguing drink that has endured through the years. The Scofflaw embodies the rebellious spirit of the Roaring Twenties and remains a popular choice for those seeking a classic cocktail with a historical edge.

The cocktail's relative simplicity—gin, lemon juice, maraschino liqueur, and orange bitters—belies its elegant complexity. A well-made Casino showcases the quality of the gin while harmonizing the other ingredients. The inclusion of Old Tom gin can lend the Casino a slightly sweeter profile, appealing to modern palates. It exemplifies the golden age of cocktails when balance and refinement were prized.","historical_reference":"First documented in Hugo Ensslin's 'Recipes for Mixed Drinks' (1917).","technique":"Chill a coupe or Martini glass.
