f:T4df,The Michelada is a Mexican cerveza preparada, meaning 'prepared beer'. It's a savory and refreshing beer cocktail perfect for warm weather. While variations abound across Mexico, the core ingredients typically include beer, lime juice, hot sauce, and spices. The drink is often served in a salt-rimmed glass. Its versatility allows for endless customization, with regional preferences influencing the choice of beer and spice blend. The origins of the Michelada are debated, but several stories exist. One popular account traces it back to Michel Esperger, who frequented a club in San Luis Potosí and requested his beer with lime, salt, and ice. Another version suggests that the name is a portmanteau of 'mi chela helada', meaning 'my cold beer'. Regardless of its exact beginnings, the Michelada has become a beloved staple of Mexican culture, enjoyed as a brunch beverage, an afternoon refreshment, or an accompaniment to spicy cuisine. The drink represents the culinary creativity of Mexico and the resourcefulness with local ingredients. The Michelada continues to evolve, with innovative bartenders experimenting with new flavor combinations and presentations, while remaining rooted in its traditional foundation of beer, lime, and spice.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Salt"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Le","Michelada",{"cocktail":{"name":"Michelada","description":"$f","historical_reference":"Source not found","technique":"1.
