Its origins are somewhat obscure, with no clear historical record pinpointing its creation. However, it likely emerged during the early to mid-20th century, a period of cocktail experimentation and the rise of fruit-forward drinks. The cocktail showcases the appeal of simple ingredients combined in a way that enhances each component. It's a testament to the era's ingenuity, where bartenders sought to create flavorful and refreshing drinks using available spirits and citrus. It is a relatively obscure classic. While it doesn't have a prominent place in cocktail history books, its reappearance in modern cocktail bars and online resources reflects a growing appreciation for forgotten recipes. Its refreshing flavor profile makes it well suited to be a summer drink. It can also pair well with light appetizers or served as a palate cleanser between courses.","historical_reference":"Source not found","technique":"Combine all ingredients in a shaker with ice.
