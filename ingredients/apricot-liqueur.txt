f:T50c,The Angel Face is a classic equal-parts cocktail featuring gin, apricot brandy, and apple brandy (Calvados). It's a potent and somewhat challenging drink due to the interplay of the three strong spirits and the distinct flavors of apricot and apple. Its origins are a bit murky, but it gained popularity in the early 20th century, particularly in cocktail books of the era. Some credit Harry Craddock of the Savoy Hotel in London for its creation or popularization, though it appeared in earlier publications as well. The Angel Face offers a floral and fruity experience, balanced by the dryness of gin and the subtle spice of brandy. It's considered a somewhat 'forgotten' classic, often overlooked due to its assertive flavor profile, but appreciated by those who enjoy complex, spirit-forward drinks. The drink requires precision as the equal parts can easily become unbalanced. A good Angel Face is a testament to the balance and interplay of the components, creating a unique blend of botanical, fruit, and spice notes. The combination of the dry gin with the sweet and tart notes from the apricot and apple brandies creates a nuanced and surprisingly delightful cocktail. It's an excellent drink for exploring the range of flavors that can be achieved with seemingly simple ingredients.10:T412,The Delilah cocktail is a relatively modern creation that balances the dryness of gin with the sweetness of apricot liqueur and the tartness of lemon juice. The addition of Lillet Blanc contributes floral and honeyed notes, enhancing the drink's complexity. It's typically served in a coupe glass and garnished with a lemon twist or brandied cherry. Its exact origins are somewhat obscure, lacking definitive historical records. It is not directly associated with a particular bartender or bar, but rather seems to have emerged as a popular recipe in contemporary cocktail circles. The balance between gin, liqueur, and citrus makes it a refreshing yet sophisticated choice. The Delilah is an excellent example of a cocktail that showcases how classic ingredients can be combined to create a new and appealing flavor profile. It's a good choice for gin lovers looking for something a little different from the standard gin and tonic or martini, offering a sweeter, more approachable profile while still maintaining a degree of sophistication.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Apricot Liqueur"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Le","Cloister",{"cocktail":{"name":"Cloister","description":"The Cloister is a sophisticated cocktail that balances gin's botanical character with the sweetness of apricot liqueur and the tartness of citrus.
