10:T446,The Sherry Cobbler is a classic cocktail with a rich history, dating back to the early 19th century. It gained immense popularity in the United States during the 1830s and 1840s, becoming a ubiquitous drink in bars and homes alike. Its appeal stemmed from its refreshing nature, ease of preparation, and the versatility offered by using different types of sherry. Often served in a tall glass filled with shaved ice and adorned with an array of fresh fruit, the Sherry Cobbler was as much a visual delight as it was a flavorful one. It was one of the first mixed drinks to be enjoyed through a straw. Historical accounts suggest that the Sherry Cobbler was a favorite of prominent figures, further cementing its status as a sophisticated and fashionable beverage. Over time, the Sherry Cobbler's popularity waned, but it has experienced a resurgence in recent years as bartenders and cocktail enthusiasts rediscover classic recipes and appreciate the drink's unique qualities. Its enduring appeal lies in its simplicity, elegance, and the delightful combination of sherry, sweetness, and fruit.11:T4c9,The Ramos Gin Fizz, also known as the New Orleans Fizz, is a classic cocktail renowned for its creamy texture, complex flavors, and elaborate preparation. Created in 1888 by Henry C. Ramos at his bar, the Imperial Cabinet Saloon, in New Orleans, it quickly gained popularity and became a signature drink of the city. The key to a proper Ramos Gin Fizz is the vigorous shaking, traditionally lasting for an extended period, often involving multiple bartenders to share the task. This intense shaking emulsifies the egg white and dairy, creating a frothy and velvety smooth texture. The combination of gin, citrus, cream, egg white, orange flower water, and soda water results in a harmonious blend of flavors – floral, citrusy, sweet, and slightly tart. The orange flower water imparts a delicate floral aroma that is characteristic of the drink. The addition of soda water at the end creates a light and effervescent quality. The Ramos Gin Fizz is a testament to the creativity and craftsmanship of classic cocktail making, demanding attention to detail and a dedication to achieving the perfect balance of flavors and textures. It remains a beloved cocktail, cherished for its unique character and historical significance.12:T51d,Grog, a historical drink deeply rooted in naval tradition, emerged as a practical solution to preserve sailors' health and morale during long voyages. Originally, sailors were given a daily ration of rum, but its high strength led to issues of drunkenness and insubordination. In 1740, Vice Admiral Edward Vernon of the British Royal Navy, nicknamed 'Old Grog' for his grogram coat, ordered that the rum be diluted with water. This measure aimed to reduce intoxication and improve discipline. Over time, the basic recipe was adapted, with additions of citrus juice to combat scurvy, and sugar to enhance palatability. The resulting concoction, known as 'Grog,' became a staple on naval ships. The combination of rum, water, citrus, and sugar offered a rudimentary but effective way to hydrate, provide vitamin C, and boost morale in the harsh maritime environment. Today, Grog continues to be enjoyed, often with variations that reflect personal taste and regional preferences. It stands as a testament to the resourcefulness and practicality of naval life in the age of sail, a tangible link to the traditions and challenges faced by sailors of the past. Its enduring appeal lies in its simplicity, adaptability, and historical significance as a beverage that sustained and fortified seafarers for centuries.13:T43d,Hoppelpoppel, also spelled Hoppel poppel, is a traditional German and Austrian drink, often served warm. It's essentially a boozy, custardy concoction that's perfect for colder weather or as a comforting dessert beverage. The exact origins are somewhat hazy, like many traditional drinks passed down through generations. The base usually involves eggs, milk or cream, sugar, and a spirit such as rum or genever, or even brandy. Recipes vary from family to family, region to region, with personal preferences dictating the final outcome. Some versions include spices like cinnamon or nutmeg for added warmth and complexity. Think of it as a cross between eggnog and a hot toddy, adapted to use readily available ingredients and local tastes of Central Europe. It's more commonly homemade than commercially produced, embodying the spirit of cozy, home-spun hospitality. The rich, creamy texture and the warming alcoholic kick make it a delightful and satisfying beverage, particularly during the winter months or festive occasions. It is often enjoyed after a meal or as a special treat.14:T458,The Tom and Jerry is a warm, comforting cocktail perfect for cold weather. It's essentially a hot batter mixed with spirits and hot water or milk. The batter is typically made with eggs, sugar, spices (such as cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves), and sometimes butter or cream. The drink is traditionally served in a mug and garnished with grated nutmeg. Its origins are often attributed to Pierce Egan, a British sports writer, who created it in the 1820s. While Egan may have popularized it, similar hot egg-based drinks existed before. The Tom and Jerry gained immense popularity in the United States, particularly during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Pre-made Tom and Jerry batter mixes were even commercially available, simplifying the preparation process. While its popularity has waned somewhat in recent years, the Tom and Jerry remains a beloved holiday tradition for many families. Its warming spices and creamy texture evoke feelings of nostalgia and festive cheer. The preparation is somewhat involved compared to simpler cocktails, but the resulting drink is a truly special and memorable experience.15:T4fd,Although often credited to Pierce Egan in the 1820s, similar hot egg drinks existed before. Source: David Wondrich, Imbibe! (Revised and Updated Edition) (2015). First recipe appeared in print in 1854. Source: Jerry Thomas, How to Mix Drinks (1862). Variations are numerous, but this is a widely accepted recipe and historical data is correct as of October 26, 2023, 12:18 PST. All volumes are approximate only, and can be altered to suit your specific tastes. This recipe can be adjusted to suit different taste preferences (sweeter, spicier, boozier). Batches of the 'batter' may be pre-made and frozen for later use. This can be made using an immersion blender instead of whisking for a smoother and more integrated consistency. Milk can be replaced with hot water, although it changes the experience significantly and is not recommended for those who have never tried it before. Brandy can be used instead of cognac if you prefer, although it significantly alters the flavor profile. Serve with a spoon to allow the batter to be reincorporated if it begins to settle to the bottom of the mug. This is a rich, dense, and decadent drink, and due to the high volume of batter, it is recommended to consume it only in moderate quantities as it is a relatively caloric beverage.7:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Sugar"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Lf","Sherry Cobbler",{"cocktail":{"name":"Sherry Cobbler","description":"$10","historical_reference":"Mentioned in Jerry Thomas's 'How to Mix Drinks' (1862) and widely popular throughout the 19th century.","technique":"In a shaker, muddle sugar with water until sugar is dissolved.

Its exact origins are somewhat murky, but it's widely believed to have evolved from earlier medicinal drinks in Cuba. One common story suggests it originated with Sir Francis Drake, who supposedly created a similar drink called 'El Draque' using a crude form of rum, mint, lime, and sugar. Over time, El Draque evolved into the Mojito we know today, with the substitution of aguardiente with rum and the addition of soda water. The Mojito gained international popularity thanks to Ernest Hemingway, who frequented La Bodeguita del Medio in Havana and famously praised the bar's Mojitos. The cocktail's balance of sweetness, acidity, and herbal notes makes it an ideal choice for warm weather and casual gatherings. Modern variations often include different fruits or flavored syrups, but the classic Mojito remains a timeless favorite.","historical_reference":"While difficult to pinpoint a single source, David Wondrich's 'Imbibe!' provides extensive historical context on the evolution of rum drinks in Cuba, leading to the Mojito's development.
