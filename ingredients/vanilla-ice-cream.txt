10:T434,The Mudslide is a decadent and creamy cocktail that's essentially an alcoholic milkshake. It's believed to have originated in the 1970s at the Wreck Bar & Grill on Grand Cayman Island. Legend has it that a customer requested a White Russian, but they were out of cream, so they substituted Irish cream liqueur. The result was so delicious it became a regular menu item, eventually evolving into the frozen Mudslide we know today. The drink quickly gained popularity in tourist destinations and spread worldwide. While the exact recipe varies, the core components of coffee liqueur, Irish cream liqueur, and vodka (or sometimes rum or whiskey) remain consistent. The blended or shaken preparation, along with the ice cream, contributes to its thick and indulgent texture. Today, the Mudslide is enjoyed as a dessert cocktail, often served with a chocolate drizzle or shavings to enhance its visual appeal and flavor profile. Its simplicity and deliciousness have made it a staple at beach bars and resorts around the globe, continuing to evolve and inspire creative variations.7:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Vanilla Ice Cream"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Lf","Mudslide",{"cocktail":{"name":"Mudslide","description":"$10","historical_reference":"Source not found","technique":"Combine vodka, coffee liqueur, Irish cream liqueur, and vanilla ice cream in a blender.
