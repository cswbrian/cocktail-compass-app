It's essentially a julep variation that embraces seasonal fruits and herbs. Originating in the 19th century, the Smash was popularized by legendary bartenders like Jerry Thomas, who included a recipe in his seminal book, 'How to Mix Drinks' (1862). The beauty of the Smash lies in its adaptability; the base spirit can be customized, and the fresh ingredients vary according to what's available. Mint is a common element, but other herbs and fruits, like berries, peaches, and cucumbers, can also be incorporated. The drink is typically built in the glass, allowing the ingredients to meld together through muddling and dilution from ice. The final result is a vibrant, aromatic, and balanced beverage that is perfect for warm weather gatherings.","historical_reference":"Jerry Thomas, 'How to Mix Drinks' (1862) includes recipes resembling the modern smash, solidifying its 19th-century origins.","technique":"In a shaker tin, gently muddle the mint leaves and fresh fruit with the simple syrup.
