f:T4c9,The Ramos Gin Fizz, also known as the New Orleans Fizz, is a classic cocktail renowned for its creamy texture, complex flavors, and elaborate preparation. Created in 1888 by Henry C. Ramos at his bar, the Imperial Cabinet Saloon, in New Orleans, it quickly gained popularity and became a signature drink of the city. The key to a proper Ramos Gin Fizz is the vigorous shaking, traditionally lasting for an extended period, often involving multiple bartenders to share the task. This intense shaking emulsifies the egg white and dairy, creating a frothy and velvety smooth texture. The combination of gin, citrus, cream, egg white, orange flower water, and soda water results in a harmonious blend of flavors – floral, citrusy, sweet, and slightly tart. The orange flower water imparts a delicate floral aroma that is characteristic of the drink. The addition of soda water at the end creates a light and effervescent quality. The Ramos Gin Fizz is a testament to the creativity and craftsmanship of classic cocktail making, demanding attention to detail and a dedication to achieving the perfect balance of flavors and textures. It remains a beloved cocktail, cherished for its unique character and historical significance.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Orange Flower Water"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Le","Ramos Gin Fizz",{"cocktail":{"name":"Ramos Gin Fizz","description":"$f","historical_reference":"The cocktail was invented in 1888 by Henry C.
