The ritual involves balancing a shot of sake on chopsticks over a glass of beer and then, upon a coordinated shout (often 'Sake Bomb!'), dislodging the sake into the beer. This results in a fizzy mixture that is typically consumed quickly. While the exact origins are debated, the Sake Bomb gained popularity in the United States during the late 20th century, becoming a symbol of convivial, if somewhat rowdy, gatherings. The appeal lies not so much in the complex flavors, but rather in the shared experience and playful nature of the ritual. Sake bombs are intended for quick consumption and are often associated with celebrations. Some establishments have adapted variations, but the core principle of sake mixed with beer remains constant. It is important to drink responsibly and be mindful of alcohol consumption.","historical_reference":"Source not found","technique":"1. Fill a pint glass about 3/4 full with beer. 2. Balance a pair of chopsticks horizontally across the top of the glass. 3. Place a shot glass containing sake on top of the chopsticks, balancing it in the middle. 4. Coordinate a shout (e.g., 'Sake Bomb!') with your companions, then sharply strike the table, causing the chopsticks to separate and the shot of sake to fall into the beer. 5. Immediately consume the mixture.","garnish":"None","allergens":["None"],"baseSpirits":[{"amount":45,"name":"Sake","unit":"ml","rationale":"Sake provides the primary alcoholic element and characteristic flavor profile, contributing mild sweetness and umami notes."},{"amount":355,"name":"Beer","unit":"ml","rationale":"Beer adds carbonation and bitterness, creating a contrasting element that enhances the sake's flavor and delivers the 'bomb' effect through rapid consumption."}],"liqueurs":[],"ingredients":[],"flavor_descriptors":["Umami","Yeasty","Grassy"],"flavor_profile":{"body":4,"booziness":3,"bubbles":true,"complexity":2,"sourness":2,"sweetness":3}}}]]}]]}]}]
