f:T4e4,The Breakfast Martini, created by Salvatore Calabrese in 1990s, isn't your typical morning cocktail; it's an anytime sophisticated sipper. Inspired by his wife's love of marmalade on toast, Calabrese ingeniously translated that breakfast staple into a cocktail. The key is orange marmalade, which is not merely an ingredient but the soul of the drink. It provides a bittersweet citrus note that's both familiar and intriguing. Paired with gin, lemon juice, and a dash of orange liqueur, the Breakfast Martini strikes a delightful balance between sweet, sour, and boozy. The gin offers a botanical complexity that complements the marmalade's citrus notes. The lemon juice adds a necessary tartness, cutting through the sweetness and brightening the overall flavor. A touch of orange liqueur elevates the citrus profile, adding depth and aromatics. The Breakfast Martini stands as a testament to Calabrese's creativity and mastery of cocktail crafting. It's a drink that manages to be both comforting and elegant, making it a perfect choice for those seeking a unique and memorable cocktail experience. It's a modern classic that has found its place on cocktail menus worldwide, appreciated for its innovative flavor combination and its intriguing story.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Orange Marmalade"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Le","Breakfast Martini",{"cocktail":{"name":"Breakfast Martini","description":"$f","historical_reference":"Created by Salvatore Calabrese at the Library Bar in the Lanesborough Hotel, London, in the late 1990s.
