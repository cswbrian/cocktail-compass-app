f:T450,Although the exact origin is debated, Fernand Petiot is frequently cited as the creator of both the Bloody Mary and Red Snapper during his time at the St. Regis Hotel in New York, around the 1930s. Sources from the time confirm the popularity of tomato juice-based cocktails. "Esquire's Handbook for Hosts" (1949) features a recipe for a "Bloody Mary" with similar ingredients, suggesting the Red Snapper was a variation of the Bloody Mary with gin instead of vodka. A reference for Petiot creating something along the lines of this drink is from "About Town" magazine, Dec. 1939 and a write up that mentions that Petiot said he started the drink while at Harry's New York Bar in Paris in 1921, before bringing it with him to the St. Regis in New York. Then, some patrons requested vodka in it instead of gin, which is how the Bloody Mary was born according to Petiot. The Esquire handbook calls for the drink to have, "1 jigger of Vodka, twice as much chilled tomato juice, 1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce, a dash of lemon juice, several grains of celery salt, and a liberal grinding of black pepper."6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Pinch Celery Salt"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Le","Red Snapper",{"cocktail":{"name":"Red Snapper","description":"The Red Snapper is essentially a Bloody Mary made with gin instead of vodka. Fernand Petiot, a bartender at the St. Regis Hotel in New York, is often credited with inventing both the Bloody Mary and the Red Snapper in the 1930s. However, similar tomato juice-based cocktails existed before this time. The name \"Red Snapper\" was allegedly given because the hotel's bar was called King Cole Bar, and it was thought that guests might be hesitant to order a drink called \"Bloody Mary.\" The cocktail gained popularity for its savory and spicy flavor profile, offering a brunch-friendly alternative to sweeter cocktails. Over time, bartenders have refined the recipe, experimenting with different spices, hot sauces, and garnishes to create unique variations, but the core of gin, tomato juice, and spices remains the same. It is a popular morning cocktail, often enjoyed as a hangover cure or with brunch. It has become a classic cocktail because of its unique savory flavour and its easily modifiable base ingredients.","historical_reference":"$f","technique":"Combine all ingredients in a mixing glass with ice.
