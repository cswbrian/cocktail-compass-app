f:T43a,Fernet con Coca, or Fernet and Coke, is a popular highball cocktail, particularly in Argentina. It's a simple yet surprisingly complex drink where the bitter, herbaceous Fernet Branca is balanced by the sweetness and effervescence of Coca-Cola. The combination is unexpectedly refreshing, and the Fernet's menthol and spice notes cut through the sweetness of the cola. The drink's popularity in Argentina is legendary; it's often considered the national drink and is consumed in vast quantities, especially among younger generations. While the exact origins of the combination are unclear, its spread can be attributed to the local production of Fernet Branca and the widespread availability of Coca-Cola. It's become a social ritual, often enjoyed during 'previas' (pre-parties) or as a digestif after meals. The drink's appeal lies in its contrasting flavors that somehow complement each other, making it a unique and beloved beverage. The ratio of Fernet to Coke is a matter of personal preference, but a common starting point is around 30% Fernet to 70% Coke, adjusted to taste.10:T487,The Hanky Panky, a classic cocktail invented by Ada 'Coley' Coleman, head bartender at the American Bar at the Savoy Hotel in London, around the early 1900s, is a sophisticated and complex drink. It's a variation on the Martini, but with the addition of sweet vermouth and a few dashes of Fernet-Branca, giving it a bitter, herbal edge that distinguishes it from its predecessor. Coleman was one of the few female bartenders of her time, and her creation quickly gained popularity among patrons of the Savoy. The name 'Hanky Panky' supposedly came from Coleman's exclamation upon tasting the finished cocktail, declaring it 'the real hanky-panky!' The drink is stirred, not shaken, to maintain its smooth texture, and served in a chilled cocktail glass. The interplay of the gin, vermouth, and Fernet-Branca creates a unique flavor profile, balancing the botanical notes of the gin with the sweet, slightly spicy vermouth and the intensely bitter and herbaceous Fernet-Branca. The orange zest garnish adds a bright, citrusy aroma, enhancing the overall experience of the cocktail. Its creation at such a prestigious bar cemented its place in cocktail history.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Fernet Branca"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Le","Fernet con Coca",{"cocktail":{"name":"Fernet con Coca","description":"$f","historical_reference":"Source not found","technique":"Fill a highball glass with ice.
