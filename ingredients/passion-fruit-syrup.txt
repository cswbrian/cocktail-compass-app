It's a drink that balances sweet, sour, and spicy elements, with a prominent rum presence enhanced by the herbal and citrus notes of the other ingredients. The Cobra's Fang is thought to have originated in the mid-20th century during the height of the tiki craze, though its exact provenance is debated. Many credit Don the Beachcomber or Trader Vic with creating variations of this multi-layered drink. It stands out due to its unique combination of rums, spices, and citrus, making it a favorite among tiki enthusiasts who appreciate bold flavors and complexity. Due to the strength and complexity of this beverage, it makes a great conversation starter, a sure way to impress your friends. It is often served in a large format, such as a punch bowl, to be shared among a group.","historical_reference":"Source not found","technique":"1. Combine all ingredients in a shaker with ice. 2.
