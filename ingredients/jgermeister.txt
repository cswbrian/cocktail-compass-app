Its playful name and ease of preparation have contributed to its popularity, especially in social settings. While the exact origins are difficult to pinpoint, it's generally agreed that the shot gained traction in the late 20th or early 21st century, likely emerging from bar culture where creative mixology and novelty drinks thrive. The combination of ingredients creates a balance between sweetness from the peach schnapps and cranberry juice, and a contrasting herbal bitterness and spice from the Jägermeister. It's often served as a celebratory shot due to its bright color and appealing taste, offering an experience that is both fun and flavorful. The layered effect adds to its visual appeal, making it a popular choice for those seeking a visually impressive and palatable shot. Because of the shot's relative novelty, solid historical sources are sparse.","historical_reference":"Source not found","technique":"Carefully layer the ingredients in a shot glass in the following order: Peach Schnapps, Jägermeister, then Cranberry Juice.
