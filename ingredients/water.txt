f:T409,The Bumbo is a historical rum punch, tracing back to the 17th and 18th centuries, often associated with sailors and maritime culture. It's a simple yet potent concoction designed for warmth and sustenance during long voyages. The drink’s precise origins are somewhat murky, but it's believed to have been a staple aboard ships, where rum was readily available and other ingredients like water, sugar, and nutmeg could be sourced or traded. As a drink of the sea, its recipe varied depending on available ingredients and the whims of the ship's cook or the sailors themselves. Over time, the Bumbo has evolved from a sailor's staple to a cocktail enjoyed for its historical significance and simple, satisfying flavor. Contemporary versions offer a taste of maritime history, providing a flavorful glimpse into the drinking habits of seafarers long ago. Today, the Bumbo serves as a reminder of the ingenuity and resourcefulness of sailors who created a palatable and fortifying beverage from the limited resources at their disposal.10:T47c,Fish House Punch is a potent and historic American punch, traditionally associated with the State in Schuylkill fishing club near Philadelphia. Its exact origins are somewhat murky, but it's believed to date back to the early 18th century, possibly even earlier. The club, known for its convivial gatherings and dedication to angling, is credited with creating and popularizing the punch. The original recipe was a closely guarded secret, passed down through generations of club members. Over time, variations emerged, but the core components remained consistent: rum, cognac, peach brandy, citrus, and sugar. The punch was often served at elaborate feasts and social events hosted by the club, becoming a symbol of hospitality and camaraderie. Its reputation spread throughout the colonies and eventually across the United States. Fish House Punch is more than just a cocktail; it's a piece of American history, a testament to the traditions of early American social clubs and their contribution to the development of cocktail culture. Its enduring appeal lies in its complex flavor profile and its ability to bring people together in celebration.11:T446,The Sherry Cobbler is a classic cocktail with a rich history, dating back to the early 19th century. It gained immense popularity in the United States during the 1830s and 1840s, becoming a ubiquitous drink in bars and homes alike. Its appeal stemmed from its refreshing nature, ease of preparation, and the versatility offered by using different types of sherry. Often served in a tall glass filled with shaved ice and adorned with an array of fresh fruit, the Sherry Cobbler was as much a visual delight as it was a flavorful one. It was one of the first mixed drinks to be enjoyed through a straw. Historical accounts suggest that the Sherry Cobbler was a favorite of prominent figures, further cementing its status as a sophisticated and fashionable beverage. Over time, the Sherry Cobbler's popularity waned, but it has experienced a resurgence in recent years as bartenders and cocktail enthusiasts rediscover classic recipes and appreciate the drink's unique qualities. Its enduring appeal lies in its simplicity, elegance, and the delightful combination of sherry, sweetness, and fruit.12:T5ef,Quentão, meaning "very hot" or "big hot one" in Portuguese, is a traditional Brazilian hot drink served during the Festa Junina (June Festival). These festivals are celebrated throughout Brazil during the month of June and feature music, dance, and traditional foods and drinks. Quentão is particularly popular in the southern states of Brazil, where the weather is cooler during this time of year. The drink is a warming and aromatic concoction, typically made with cachaça (a spirit distilled from sugarcane juice), ginger, cinnamon, cloves, sugar, and citrus fruits. The mixture is simmered together, allowing the flavors to meld and infuse the cachaça, creating a beverage that is both comforting and festive. Variations exist, with some recipes including apples, star anise, or other spices. Quentão is usually served hot in mugs or glasses, and it is often enjoyed outdoors around bonfires or at street fairs. Its warming properties and spicy-sweet flavor make it a perfect drink for chilly evenings and celebratory occasions, embodying the spirit of Brazilian hospitality and tradition. The aroma of Quentão simmering on the stove is a familiar and welcoming scent during Festa Junina, evoking feelings of community and celebration. It's a simple drink to prepare but its complex flavors make it a true Brazilian classic, deeply rooted in the country's cultural heritage and culinary traditions. Enjoying a cup of Quentão is a way to experience the warmth and joy of Festa Junina, no matter where you are.13:T4ba,The Brandy Old Fashioned is a variation of the classic Old Fashioned cocktail, substituting whiskey with brandy as the base spirit. Originating in the 19th century, the Old Fashioned is considered one of the original cocktails, highlighting the spirit with sugar, bitters, and water. The brandy version gained popularity in the Midwest, particularly in Wisconsin, where brandy production and consumption have a strong tradition. In Wisconsin, it's common to specify the drink 'sweet,' which includes soda; 'sour,' with lemon-lime soda; or 'press,' which uses both club soda and lemon-lime soda. A proper Brandy Old Fashioned showcases the quality of the brandy, complemented by the sweetness and aromatic bitters. The addition of fruit as a muddled component is a popular variation, although purists may argue against it. Whether enjoyed with or without fruit, the Brandy Old Fashioned delivers a balanced and flavorful experience, highlighting the richness and complexity of brandy. It is a testament to the adaptability of classic cocktails and regional preferences in cocktail culture. The simplicity of the drink allows for variations catering to individual tastes, making it a beloved and enduring choice.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Water"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Le","Bumbo",{"cocktail":{"name":"Bumbo","description":"$f","historical_reference":"David Wondrich, \"Punch: The Delights (and Dangers) of the Flowing Bowl\" (2010)","technique":"In a mug or heat-resistant glass, dissolve brown sugar in warm water.

As cocktail recipes became more elaborate, some drinkers preferred the simpler, original style of a spirit, sugar, water, and bitters. This preference led to the coining of the term 'Old Fashioned' to specify this classic preparation. The exact origin is debated, but it's often associated with Louisville, Kentucky, and the Pendennis Club. Over time, variations arose, sometimes incorporating fruit like oranges and cherries, which are now common but considered optional by purists.
