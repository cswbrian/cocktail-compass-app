Its origins are debated, but it gained popularity in the mid-20th century and has become a staple in classic cocktail culture. The drink is appreciated for its straightforward preparation and its ability to showcase the quality of the Scotch used. It's a stirred drink, typically served on the rocks, and is a favorite among those who enjoy a strong, spirit-forward cocktail with a touch of sweetness. The combination of Scotch and Drambuie creates a complex flavor profile that is both comforting and intriguing. The drink is easy to customize to your liking; some prefer more scotch, some prefer more drambuie.","historical_reference":"First mentioned in print in 1937, and popularized by the British Industries Fair in 1963.
