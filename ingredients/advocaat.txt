f:T4f0,The Fluffy Duck is a rich, decadent cocktail known for its creamy texture and sweet, dessert-like flavor profile. It is a concoction that blends gin, Advocaat, white crème de cacao, fresh cream, and a touch of fizz. The combination results in a drink that is both comforting and indulgent, making it a popular choice for those with a sweet tooth or as an after-dinner treat. Its origins can be traced back to the 1970s, gaining popularity for its unique blend of textures and flavors. It is a testament to the era's experimental approach to mixology, focusing on creating enjoyable and memorable drinking experiences. Although relatively simple to prepare, the Fluffy Duck requires careful balancing of ingredients to achieve the desired velvety smoothness and sweetness. It is typically served in a coupe or cocktail glass, often without garnish to showcase its creamy appearance. This cocktail represents a departure from more traditional, spirit-forward drinks, embracing a sweeter, more approachable profile. It caters to a palate that enjoys creamy, dessert-like cocktails and is perfect for special occasions or casual gatherings. The cocktail is often linked with the Dutch spirit Advocaat, which contributes significantly to its unique flavor and texture.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Advocaat"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Le","Fluffy Duck",{"cocktail":{"name":"Fluffy Duck","description":"$f","historical_reference":"Difford's Guide identifies the Fluffy Duck cocktail dating back to the 1970s.
