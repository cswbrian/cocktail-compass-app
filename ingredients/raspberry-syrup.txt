The cocktail represents a piece of cocktail history, a time when drinks were crafted with fresh ingredients and attention to detail. Its balanced profile and attractive appearance make it a favorite among those who appreciate sophisticated and flavorful concoctions.

It originated at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia, where the Clover Club Society, a group of lawyers and writers, regularly met. The cocktail gained popularity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, appearing in numerous cocktail books. Its blend of gin, raspberry syrup, lemon juice, and egg white creates a silky texture and a delightful combination of sweet, tart, and floral notes. The egg white not only contributes to the creamy texture but also softens the sharpness of the other ingredients, creating a harmonious drink. The Clover Club experienced a decline in popularity during the mid-20th century but has seen a resurgence in recent years as classic cocktails have made a comeback. Modern variations sometimes include different types of gin or raspberry-flavored liqueurs, but the core elements remain the same: a balance of sweet, sour, and spirit with a velvety texture. This pink drink makes it an excellent choice for a brunch cocktail or any occasion where a refreshing and visually appealing drink is desired. Its historical significance and refined flavor make it a timeless classic.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Raspberry Syrup"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Le","Clover Club",{"cocktail":{"name":"Clover Club","description":"$f","historical_reference":"First documented in print by The Evening Telegraph (Philadelphia) on January 21, 1897, and later popularized by the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia and included in \"The Savoy Cocktail Book\" (1930) by Harry Craddock.","technique":"1.
