Another possibility points to a tool called a 'gimlet,' used to bore holes into barrels, suggesting a link to the cocktail's potent and piercing nature. The original Gimlet likely used lime cordial, such as Rose's, for both sweetness and citrus flavor. Over time, preferences shifted toward fresh lime juice and simple syrup or sugar, offering a brighter and more balanced profile.

It's said that he crafted a refreshing gin punch that became a favorite among patrons and was later named after him. Another anecdote attributes the drink's creation to a bartender of the same name, who worked at a hotel in New York in the 1870s. Whatever its true origins, the Tom Collins gained immense popularity in the late 19th century and has remained a beloved classic ever since.

The modern Mojito, made with rum, gained popularity in the early 20th century, particularly at the Havana bar La Bodeguita del Medio, famously frequented by Ernest Hemingway. The Virgin Mojito emerged later, as a response to the growing demand for sophisticated non-alcoholic drinks.

The John Collins is essentially a gin sour lengthened with carbonated water, making it a refreshing and effervescent drink, perfect for warm weather. It belongs to the Collins family of cocktails, which are distinguished by their use of a base spirit, lemon juice, sugar, and carbonated water, served in a tall glass over ice. Variations exist using other base spirits, resulting in drinks like the Tom Collins (gin), the Vodka Collins (vodka), and the Rum Collins (rum).
