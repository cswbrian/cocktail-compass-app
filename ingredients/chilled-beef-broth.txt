f:T45b,The Bull Shot is a savory cocktail, often described as a variation of the Bloody Mary, but using beef bouillon or consommé instead of tomato juice. It is a simple drink with a salty, umami-rich flavor profile, making it a popular choice as a brunch or hair-of-the-dog beverage. The origins of the Bull Shot are somewhat murky, with several stories claiming its invention. One common narrative suggests that it was created in the 1950s at Detroit's Caucus Club, invented by bartender Toby Cecchini. The Bull Shot gained popularity throughout the mid-20th century, appearing in cocktail guides and bar menus. Despite its savory profile, the Bull Shot has remained a niche drink, perhaps due to the strong flavor of beef bouillon, which may not appeal to all palates. However, its simplicity and unique taste make it a notable and intriguing member of the cocktail family. It is usually served cold, and the addition of spices and hot sauce can further customize the drink to individual preferences. It is a cocktail with a distinctive character, appealing to those who enjoy savory and umami flavors in their drinks.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Chilled Beef Broth"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Le","Bull Shot",{"cocktail":{"name":"Bull Shot","description":"$f","historical_reference":"Source not found","technique":"In a highball glass filled with ice, add vodka, beef broth, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, black pepper, and celery salt.
