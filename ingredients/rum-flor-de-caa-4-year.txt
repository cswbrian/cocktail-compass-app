10:T42d,The Macuá is considered the national drink of Nicaragua. Named after a tropical bird native to the country, it is a refreshing and vibrant cocktail that embodies the spirit of Nicaragua. The drink gained popularity relatively recently, solidifying its status as a modern classic. Its creation is often attributed to bartenders seeking a signature drink that highlighted local ingredients. The Macuá cleverly combines Nicaraguan rum with guava juice, lime juice, and simple syrup, creating a balance of sweet, tart, and fruity flavors. The cocktail's appeal lies in its simplicity and refreshing character, making it a perfect choice for warm climates. The combination of rum and guava creates a unique tropical flavor profile that is both familiar and exciting. Garnished with a slice of orange or plantain chip, the Macuá is visually appealing and adds to the overall sensory experience. Its refreshing character and ease of preparation have contributed to its increasing popularity in bars and restaurants worldwide, securing its place as a beloved modern classic.7:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Rum (Flor de Caña 4 Year)"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Lf","Macuá",{"cocktail":{"name":"Macuá","description":"$10","historical_reference":"Source not found","technique":"Combine all ingredients in a shaker with ice.
