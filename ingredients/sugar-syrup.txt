A combination of sweet, bitter, and spicy notes intertwined to create a smooth and satisfying experience. The Revolving Door stands out due to its careful balancing of the inherent spiciness of rye with the subtle sweetness of the liqueur and the aromatic bitterness of the bitters. This creates a cocktail that is both assertive and approachable, perfect for those who appreciate the nuances of fine spirits. It is best enjoyed slowly, allowing the flavors to evolve and reveal themselves over time. The cocktail is served chilled and without ice, ensuring that the flavors remain concentrated and undiluted.","historical_reference":"Source not found","technique":"1.

Santini meticulously crafted each drink, emphasizing quality ingredients and presentation, and even sold the recipe to other bartenders. The cocktail achieved considerable popularity during its time and gained recognition through early cocktail guides, influencing the evolution of other sour-style drinks. Its elaborate presentation and refined taste made it a sought-after choice for discerning drinkers.","historical_reference":"David Wondrich, Imbibe!
