10:T484,The Porto Flip is a classic cocktail dating back to the 17th century, a rich and decadent drink traditionally enjoyed as a nightcap. It's a fortified wine cocktail, showcasing the robust character of Port wine, enriched with egg yolk and a touch of sweetness. The egg yolk imparts a creamy texture and enhances the overall richness, while a grating of nutmeg provides a warm, aromatic finish. Flips, as a category, were originally made with beer, rum and sugar, heated with a hot poker, but eventually evolved into the egg-enriched, spirit-based drinks we know today. The Porto Flip remains a timeless example of a simple yet luxurious cocktail, perfect for cooler evenings or as an indulgent treat. Its simplicity highlights the quality of the ingredients, making it a favorite among those who appreciate both classic cocktails and the nuances of fortified wine. The combination of port, egg, and sugar creates a velvety smooth experience, leaving a lasting impression of comfort and sophistication. Variations may include adding a dash of brandy for extra strength or using different types of Port, such as Tawny, for a slightly different flavor profile.7:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Ruby Port"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Lf","Porto Flip",{"cocktail":{"name":"Porto Flip","description":"$10","historical_reference":"Harry Johnson's Bartenders' Manual (1882) features a Flip recipe, although the Porto Flip is most commonly found in later publications.","technique":"1.
