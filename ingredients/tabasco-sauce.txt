f:T424,The Queen Mary cocktail is a savory and refreshing variation of the classic Bloody Mary. While the Bloody Mary is traditionally enjoyed as a brunch or morning beverage, the Queen Mary offers a lighter and more nuanced flavor profile that can be enjoyed any time of day. The use of gin instead of vodka is another key change. The precise origins of the Queen Mary are murky, with no definitive historical record pointing to its creation. It is likely a modern adaptation created by bartenders looking to experiment with the popular Bloody Mary template. The drink's elegance and balanced flavors have made it a favorite among cocktail enthusiasts seeking a less intense and more complex version of the original. Often, the Queen Mary is named such to differentiate that oysters, or clam juice are to be included in the drink. The savory nature of the ingredients, and the versatility with various foods makes it an ideal drink for all. It is also believed to come from Queen Mary I, often called Bloody Mary for her harsh persecutions of protestants in England.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Tabasco Sauce"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Le","Queen Mary",{"cocktail":{"name":"Queen Mary","description":"$f","historical_reference":"Source not found","technique":"Combine all ingredients in a shaker with ice.
