f:T413,The Spritzer is a refreshing and versatile cocktail known for its simplicity and effervescence. Its origins can be traced back to the 19th century in Austria and Germany, where it was initially created as a way to dilute strong wines with sparkling water. The name "Spritzer" comes from the German word "spritzen," meaning "to splash" or "to squirt," referring to the addition of sparkling water to wine. Over time, the Spritzer evolved from a simple wine and water mixture to a customizable cocktail with endless variations. The basic recipe typically includes wine (usually white or rosé), sparkling water or club soda, and optional additions like fruit slices, herbs, or liqueurs. Its appeal lies in its light and airy character, making it a perfect choice for warm weather gatherings, casual brunches, or as an aperitif. The Spritzer's customizable nature allows for endless creativity, catering to different tastes and preferences. It remains a timeless and beloved cocktail, celebrated for its simplicity, refreshment, and adaptability.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Sparkling Water"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Le","Spritzer",{"cocktail":{"name":"Spritzer","description":"$f","historical_reference":"Source not found","technique":"Fill a wine glass with ice.
