f:T424,The Stinger is a classic after-dinner cocktail known for its simple yet effective combination of spirit and mint. Its origins are debated, but it gained popularity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, often associated with high society. The drink's simplicity made it a favorite in exclusive clubs and establishments. The Stinger experienced a resurgence in popularity in the mid-20th century, often featured in movies and books, solidifying its place in cocktail culture. The combination of cognac and crème de menthe offers a refreshing contrast, with the warmth of the cognac balanced by the cool, minty liqueur. Variations include using different base spirits like brandy or whiskey, but the classic Stinger remains a timeless choice for those seeking a sophisticated and refreshing drink. It continues to be enjoyed as a digestif or a palate cleanser after a meal, cherished for its simplicity and elegant flavor profile. Today, the Stinger continues to be a cocktail that has stood the test of time and can be enjoyed across different generations.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","White Crème de Menthe"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Le","Stinger",{"cocktail":{"name":"Stinger","description":"$f","historical_reference":"First appears in print in Tom Bullock's 'The Ideal Bartender' in 1917.
