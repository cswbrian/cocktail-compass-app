10:T4f3,The Hurricane is a potent and sweet rum-based cocktail that originated in New Orleans. Its creation is attributed to Pat O'Brien's bar in the 1940s. Faced with a surplus of rum, due to distribution deals, O'Brien sought a way to move the excess spirit. He served the drink in a glass shaped like a hurricane lamp, hence the name. The original Hurricane was likely simpler than many modern versions, focusing on the combination of rum, passion fruit juice, and lime. Over time, variations have emerged, incorporating different fruit juices and sweeteners to tailor the flavor profile. The Hurricane quickly became a popular tourist drink, synonymous with the festive atmosphere of New Orleans. Its vibrant color and sweet taste make it an appealing choice, although its high alcohol content warrants caution. While often associated with Bourbon Street revelry, the Hurricane remains a significant part of New Orleans cocktail history, representing resourcefulness and adaptation in the face of market demands. The drink is typically served in a large, curvy glass that resembles a hurricane lamp, amplifying its visual appeal and contributing to its celebratory image. Different bars offer their variations, each attempting to create a unique and memorable experience.7:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Passion Fruit Juice"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Lf","Hurricane",{"cocktail":{"name":"Hurricane","description":"$10","historical_reference":"Reportedly invented at Pat O'Brien's bar in New Orleans in the 1940s to deal with a rum surplus.
