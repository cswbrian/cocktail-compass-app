10:T40e,The Horse's Neck is a simple, refreshing highball cocktail that has its roots in the late 19th century. Initially a non-alcoholic drink consisting of ginger ale and a long spiral of lemon peel draped over the edge of the glass (resembling a horse's neck), it gained alcoholic appeal with the addition of bourbon whiskey. It is a very simple cocktail, so it is imperative to use quality ingredients. The ginger ale provides a sweet and spicy base, which is accentuated by the aromatic oils released from the lemon twist. Adding bourbon gives the drink a warm, boozy kick, transforming it from a refreshing cooler into a proper cocktail. While simple, the Horse's Neck highlights how a few well-chosen ingredients can create a balanced and enjoyable drink. It's a fantastic option for those who prefer lighter, less sweet cocktails, and can be easily adapted to different spirits for varied flavor profiles. The Horse's Neck is perfect as an introductory Bourbon experience, as the ginger ale is a complement to the spice and caramel notes.11:T531,The Floradora is a refreshing and effervescent cocktail that combines the botanical notes of gin with the tangy sweetness of raspberry and lime, topped with ginger ale for a spicy kick. Its origins can be traced back to the early 20th century, named after the popular Broadway musical "Florodora," which debuted in 1900. The musical was known for its chorus line of "Florodora Girls," and the cocktail was created to capture the light, bubbly, and vibrant spirit of the show. The Floradora gained popularity during the pre-Prohibition era and has seen a resurgence in recent years as a classic cocktail. The combination of flavors makes it a delightful choice for warm weather or any occasion where a refreshing and balanced drink is desired. The Floradora cocktail presents a harmonious blend of sweetness, tartness, and spice, making it a truly enjoyable and memorable libation. Its historical association with a beloved Broadway production adds a layer of cultural significance, making it more than just a drink but a piece of entertainment history. The drink's color and effervescence also contribute to its appeal, making it a visually attractive beverage. Today, the Floradora is appreciated for its simplicity, balance, and refreshing character, making it a timeless classic that continues to delight cocktail enthusiasts.7:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Ginger Ale"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Lf","Horse's Neck",{"cocktail":{"name":"Horse's Neck","description":"$10","historical_reference":"David Wondrich's 'Imbibe!' notes that the Horse's Neck started as a non-alcoholic drink, with spirits added later.

The blend of gin and brandy lays a foundation of botanical dryness and rich fruitiness, respectively. Lime juice adds a crucial sour element, while bitters contribute a layer of herbal complexity. Ginger ale not only adds a bubbly lift, but also introduces a gentle spice that ties the whole drink together. Though originally designed to alleviate the symptoms of overindulgence, the Suffering Bastard has evolved into a classic cocktail enjoyed for its distinctive taste and historical significance.
