f:T40e,The Horse's Neck is a simple, refreshing highball cocktail that has its roots in the late 19th century. Initially a non-alcoholic drink consisting of ginger ale and a long spiral of lemon peel draped over the edge of the glass (resembling a horse's neck), it gained alcoholic appeal with the addition of bourbon whiskey. It is a very simple cocktail, so it is imperative to use quality ingredients. The ginger ale provides a sweet and spicy base, which is accentuated by the aromatic oils released from the lemon twist. Adding bourbon gives the drink a warm, boozy kick, transforming it from a refreshing cooler into a proper cocktail. While simple, the Horse's Neck highlights how a few well-chosen ingredients can create a balanced and enjoyable drink. It's a fantastic option for those who prefer lighter, less sweet cocktails, and can be easily adapted to different spirits for varied flavor profiles. The Horse's Neck is perfect as an introductory Bourbon experience, as the ginger ale is a complement to the spice and caramel notes.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Ginger Ale"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Le","Horse's Neck",{"cocktail":{"name":"Horse's Neck","description":"$f","historical_reference":"David Wondrich's 'Imbibe!' notes that the Horse's Neck started as a non-alcoholic drink, with spirits added later.

It was reportedly invented as a hangover cure for the many patrons who frequented the bar. Its mix of base spirits, lime, bitters, and ginger ale creates a complex flavor profile. The blend of gin and brandy lays a foundation of botanical dryness and rich fruitiness, respectively. Lime juice adds a crucial sour element, while bitters contribute a layer of herbal complexity. Ginger ale not only adds a bubbly lift, but also introduces a gentle spice that ties the whole drink together. Though originally designed to alleviate the symptoms of overindulgence, the Suffering Bastard has evolved into a classic cocktail enjoyed for its distinctive taste and historical significance. The combination of its diverse ingredients makes for a drink that is both invigorating and comforting, a testament to its intended purpose.","historical_reference":"David Wondrich, Imbibe!
