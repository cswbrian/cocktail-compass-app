It was created in 1957 by Harry Yee, the legendary head bartender at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki in Honolulu. Yee was asked by a Dutch sales representative from Bols to create a drink that would showcase the Bols Blue Curaçao liqueur. After experimenting with various combinations, Yee landed on a mix of rum, vodka, blue curaçao, pineapple juice, and sweet and sour mix. The drink quickly gained popularity, becoming synonymous with Hawaiian tourism and the carefree spirit of the islands. Its striking blue hue, reminiscent of the Pacific Ocean, and its refreshing taste made it a favorite among tourists and locals alike. Despite its somewhat sweet and artificial flavor profile compared to modern craft cocktails, the Blue Hawaii remains a nostalgic symbol of paradise and a testament to the enduring appeal of classic tiki drinks. The cocktail's popularity endures, symbolizing exotic getaways.","historical_reference":"According to multiple sources, the Blue Hawaii was invented in 1957 by Harry Yee, head bartender at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki in Honolulu.","technique":"Combine all ingredients in a shaker with ice.
