f:T436,Agua de Valencia is a refreshing and potent Spanish cocktail originating from Valencia. Its history begins in 1959 at the Cafe Madrid in Valencia, where regulars challenged the owner, Constante Gil, to create something new and exciting. Gil experimented and eventually concocted this blend of orange juice, cava (Spanish sparkling wine), vodka, and gin. Initially, it was exclusively served at the cafe, but its popularity quickly spread throughout Valencia and beyond. Today, it's a staple in many bars and households in Spain, particularly during festive occasions. The drink is typically served in large pitchers or jugs and shared among friends, embodying the convivial spirit of Spanish culture. Its vibrant color and citrusy aroma make it an appealing and festive choice. While the original recipe remains somewhat guarded, the core components are well-known, and many variations exist, with some bartenders adding a touch of simple syrup or other liqueurs to further customize the flavor profile. Be mindful of its high alcohol content and ensure responsible consumption.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Cava"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Le","Agua de Valencia",{"cocktail":{"name":"Agua de Valencia","description":"$f","historical_reference":"First created in 1959 at Cafe Madrid in Valencia, Spain, by Constante Gil.
