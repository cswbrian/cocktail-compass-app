It was specifically designed for the opening of The Violet Hour in Chicago. This equal-parts cocktail, named after M.I.A.'s hit song 'Paper Planes,' balances the boldness of bourbon with the bitterness of Amaro Nonino, the citrusy tang of lemon juice, and the herbal sweetness of Aperol. The result is a complex, yet refreshing drink that appeals to a wide range of palates. The equal proportion of ingredients makes it easy to remember and replicate, contributing to its widespread popularity in the craft cocktail scene. Its unique flavor profile and balanced structure have cemented its place as a modern classic, frequently found on cocktail menus worldwide. The Paper Plane's success lies in its harmonious blend of contrasting flavors, making it a standout example of contemporary mixology. It's a testament to the enduring appeal of well-balanced, thoughtfully crafted cocktails.","historical_reference":"Created in 2008 by Sam Ross for the opening of The Violet Hour in Chicago.
