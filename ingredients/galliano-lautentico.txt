Legend has it that the drink was created in 1952 by Donato 'Duke' Antone, a bartender at Duke's Blackwatch Bar in Los Angeles, California. The name supposedly came from a surfer named Harvey who frequented the bar and would bang his head against the wall after consuming a few of these cocktails. The drink's popularity surged thanks to an aggressive marketing campaign featuring a cartoon surfer. Though it experienced a decline in popularity in later years, it remains a classic example of mid-century cocktail culture. It's a simple drink with a distinctive orange and herbal flavor profile that makes it very palatable.","historical_reference":"Multiple sources attribute the creation to Donato 'Duke' Antone in 1952, with the name possibly derived from a surfer.
