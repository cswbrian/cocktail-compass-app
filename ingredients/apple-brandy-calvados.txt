While the hotel and the lounge are no longer in operation, the cocktail remains a testament to a time when stirred, spirit-forward drinks reigned supreme. Its precise origins are debated, but it gained prominence in cocktail books during the mid-20th century. The Diamondback showcases the interplay between rye whiskey and the contrasting flavors of apple brandy and yellow Chartreuse. The rye brings spice and depth, while the apple brandy contributes fruity and slightly tart notes. Yellow Chartreuse softens the edges with herbal sweetness, creating a nuanced and complex drink. It's a relatively dry cocktail, making it an excellent choice for those who appreciate the boldness of rye without excessive sweetness. The Diamondback is a sophisticated drink suitable for seasoned cocktail enthusiasts.","historical_reference":"Gary Regan's 'The Joy of Mixology' mentions it.
