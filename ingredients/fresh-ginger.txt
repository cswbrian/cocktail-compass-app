f:T5ef,Quentão, meaning "very hot" or "big hot one" in Portuguese, is a traditional Brazilian hot drink served during the Festa Junina (June Festival). These festivals are celebrated throughout Brazil during the month of June and feature music, dance, and traditional foods and drinks. Quentão is particularly popular in the southern states of Brazil, where the weather is cooler during this time of year. The drink is a warming and aromatic concoction, typically made with cachaça (a spirit distilled from sugarcane juice), ginger, cinnamon, cloves, sugar, and citrus fruits. The mixture is simmered together, allowing the flavors to meld and infuse the cachaça, creating a beverage that is both comforting and festive. Variations exist, with some recipes including apples, star anise, or other spices. Quentão is usually served hot in mugs or glasses, and it is often enjoyed outdoors around bonfires or at street fairs. Its warming properties and spicy-sweet flavor make it a perfect drink for chilly evenings and celebratory occasions, embodying the spirit of Brazilian hospitality and tradition. The aroma of Quentão simmering on the stove is a familiar and welcoming scent during Festa Junina, evoking feelings of community and celebration. It's a simple drink to prepare but its complex flavors make it a true Brazilian classic, deeply rooted in the country's cultural heritage and culinary traditions. Enjoying a cup of Quentão is a way to experience the warmth and joy of Festa Junina, no matter where you are.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Fresh Ginger"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Le","Quentão",{"cocktail":{"name":"Quentão","description":"$f","historical_reference":"Source not found","technique":"1.
