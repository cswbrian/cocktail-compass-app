Its exact origins are somewhat debated, but one popular story attributes it to a waiter named John Collins, who worked at Limmer's Old House in London. Originally, the cocktail was made with Old Tom Gin, a slightly sweeter style of gin. Over time, London Dry Gin became the more common choice. The John Collins is essentially a gin sour lengthened with carbonated water, making it a refreshing and effervescent drink, perfect for warm weather. It belongs to the Collins family of cocktails, which are distinguished by their use of a base spirit, lemon juice, sugar, and carbonated water, served in a tall glass over ice. Variations exist using other base spirits, resulting in drinks like the Tom Collins (gin), the Vodka Collins (vodka), and the Rum Collins (rum). The drink gained significant popularity during the late 19th and early 20th centuries and continues to be a beloved classic in bars around the world.","historical_reference":"Harry Johnson's Bartenders' Manual (1882) details a recipe for John Collins, indicating its prominence in the late 19th century.
