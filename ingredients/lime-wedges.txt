Its history parallels that of the original Mojito, which is believed to have originated in Havana, Cuba. The exact origins are murky, but it's thought to have evolved from a medicinal drink. Sir Francis Drake, a famous English sea captain and privateer, is sometimes associated with an early version of the Mojito, as his crew mixed aguardiente (a crude form of rum), mint, lime, and sugar to combat scurvy and dysentery. The modern Mojito, made with rum, gained popularity in the early 20th century, particularly at the Havana bar La Bodeguita del Medio, famously frequented by Ernest Hemingway. The Virgin Mojito emerged later, as a response to the growing demand for sophisticated non-alcoholic drinks. It retains the refreshing qualities of the original, relying on the vibrant flavors of mint, lime, and sparkling water to create a balanced and invigorating beverage. The Virgin Mojito provides all the refreshment without the alcohol.","historical_reference":"Source not found","technique":"1.
