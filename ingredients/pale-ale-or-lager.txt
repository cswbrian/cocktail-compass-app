Its creation is attributed to a bartender in London in 1881, though similar layered drinks likely existed before. The name refers to the colors of the layers: a light ale or lager floating atop a darker stout. Achieving the perfect separation relies on the difference in densities between the two beers and the careful pouring technique. The drink gained some notoriety due to its name being associated with a controversial British paramilitary force during the Irish War of Independence. As a result, some people avoid using the original name, preferring alternative descriptions like 'half and half' or 'lager and stout.' Despite the controversy surrounding its name, the Black and Tan remains a popular choice in many bars and pubs.","historical_reference":"The term \"Black and Tan\" possibly originated in London around 1881. However, the specific origin is not definitively documented in verifiable historical sources. Source not found.","technique":"1. Gently pour the stout into a pint glass, filling it halfway. 2. Using a spoon held upside down just above the surface of the stout, slowly pour the pale ale or lager over the back of the spoon. This distributes the lighter beer evenly and prevents it from mixing with the stout. Aim to create a distinct layer of pale ale/lager floating on top of the stout.","garnish":"None","allergens":["None"],"baseSpirits":[],"liqueurs":[],"ingredients":[{"amount":180,"name":"Pale Ale or Lager","unit":"ml","rationale":"The pale ale provides a lighter colored and less dense layer to float on top of the stout.
