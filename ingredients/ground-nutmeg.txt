f:T458,The Tom and Jerry is a warm, comforting cocktail perfect for cold weather. It's essentially a hot batter mixed with spirits and hot water or milk. The batter is typically made with eggs, sugar, spices (such as cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves), and sometimes butter or cream. The drink is traditionally served in a mug and garnished with grated nutmeg. Its origins are often attributed to Pierce Egan, a British sports writer, who created it in the 1820s. While Egan may have popularized it, similar hot egg-based drinks existed before. The Tom and Jerry gained immense popularity in the United States, particularly during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Pre-made Tom and Jerry batter mixes were even commercially available, simplifying the preparation process. While its popularity has waned somewhat in recent years, the Tom and Jerry remains a beloved holiday tradition for many families. Its warming spices and creamy texture evoke feelings of nostalgia and festive cheer. The preparation is somewhat involved compared to simpler cocktails, but the resulting drink is a truly special and memorable experience.10:T4fd,Although often credited to Pierce Egan in the 1820s, similar hot egg drinks existed before. Source: David Wondrich, Imbibe! (Revised and Updated Edition) (2015). First recipe appeared in print in 1854. Source: Jerry Thomas, How to Mix Drinks (1862). Variations are numerous, but this is a widely accepted recipe and historical data is correct as of October 26, 2023, 12:18 PST. All volumes are approximate only, and can be altered to suit your specific tastes. This recipe can be adjusted to suit different taste preferences (sweeter, spicier, boozier). Batches of the 'batter' may be pre-made and frozen for later use. This can be made using an immersion blender instead of whisking for a smoother and more integrated consistency. Milk can be replaced with hot water, although it changes the experience significantly and is not recommended for those who have never tried it before. Brandy can be used instead of cognac if you prefer, although it significantly alters the flavor profile. Serve with a spoon to allow the batter to be reincorporated if it begins to settle to the bottom of the mug. This is a rich, dense, and decadent drink, and due to the high volume of batter, it is recommended to consume it only in moderate quantities as it is a relatively caloric beverage.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Ground Nutmeg"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Le","Hot Buttered Rum",{"cocktail":{"name":"Hot Buttered Rum","description":"Hot Buttered Rum is a comforting and indulgent cocktail, perfect for cold evenings.

Variations abound, with each family often having their own unique recipe for the buttered rum batter. Some recipes call for brown sugar, others for honey or maple syrup. Spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and allspice are commonly used, adding depth and complexity to the flavor. The addition of hot water helps to melt the butter and dissolve the spices, creating a smooth and flavorful drink.
