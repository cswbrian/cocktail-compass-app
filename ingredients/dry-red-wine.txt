This float not only adds visual appeal but also introduces layers of fruit and tannin that complement the whiskey's spiciness and the lemon's acidity. The drink's origins are debated, but it gained prominence in the late 19th century, reflecting the era's penchant for complex and layered flavors. The red wine float creates a visually striking and subtly evolving flavor profile, making each sip a unique experience. Traditionally, a dry red wine like Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot is used to provide a contrasting element that enhances both the whiskey and the sour mix. Over time, variations have emerged, with some bartenders experimenting with different types of red wine to achieve specific flavor nuances. The New York Sour remains a popular choice for those seeking a balanced and visually appealing cocktail that bridges the gap between classic and contemporary mixology.","historical_reference":"Credited by some to being created in Chicago in the 1880s, originally named 'Continental Sour', according to David Wondrich's 'Imbibe!' (2015). Evidence is circumstantial.","technique":"1. Combine rye whiskey, lemon juice, simple syrup, and egg white (if using) in a shaker. 2. Dry-shake vigorously for 30 seconds (without ice). 3. Add ice to the shaker and shake again until well-chilled. 4. Strain into a rocks glass filled with ice. 5. Gently pour the red wine over the back of a spoon to float it on top of the drink.","garnish":"Orange peel or brandied cherry.
