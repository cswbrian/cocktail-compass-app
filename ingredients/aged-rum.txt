f:T44b,The Old Cuban is a sophisticated sparkling cocktail that bridges the gap between a classic Daiquiri and a French 75. Created in 2004 by renowned mixologist Audrey Saunders at the Pegu Club in New York City, it quickly gained popularity for its balanced flavors and elegant presentation. It is crafted with aged rum, fresh lime juice, simple syrup, mint, Angostura bitters, and topped with sparkling wine. The aged rum provides a rich, complex base, while the lime juice and simple syrup create a harmonious sweet and sour balance. Fresh mint adds an aromatic lift, and Angostura bitters contribute depth and complexity. The sparkling wine adds effervescence and a celebratory touch, elevating the cocktail to a more sophisticated level than a traditional Daiquiri. It is typically served in a coupe glass and garnished with a mint sprig. The Old Cuban is a refreshing and flavorful cocktail that is perfect for any occasion, embodying a modern classic with a nod to tradition. Its balance of sweet, sour, and herbal notes, combined with the bubbly texture, makes it an enjoyable and memorable drink.10:T6a6,Although precise historical record of this cocktail's initial creation is not present, it is known to have originated at the Queen's Park Hotel in Trinidad sometime in the early 20th century. The Savoy Cocktail Book, 1930 mentions swizzles generally, but not the Queen's Park Swizzle specifically. Beachbum Berry's Remixed (2009) includes the recipe and credits the Queen's Park Hotel for its origination. Dale DeGroff also features it in his book The Craft of the Cocktail (2002). The Queen's Park Hotel itself was established in 1895 and its popularity grew with the increased travel to the country. It has been said to have been created by a bartender named Joe Gomes during this period. It later became a classic cocktail in the 1920s and 1930s after it had been written about and traveled with tourists to other countries. The drink represents a piece of Trinidadian history and culture and became quite popular with the affluent travelers and island locals. The original hotel was destroyed in 1980 due to a fire. The hotel then relocated and was renamed the Hilton Trinidad and Conference Centre, where they serve the drink to honor its history today. Overall, the drink has remained popular over the years and is a reflection of the island's charm and culture. The cocktail is known for representing the essence of rum cocktails and elegance in tropical drinks and is a symbol of innovation, elegance and craftsmanship in mixology. Modern bartenders still often reference it as an example of the swizzle style of drink and inspiration behind future creations. The drink remains a symbol and nod to the history of cocktailing and the culture behind the islands of the Caribbean that inspired it.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Aged Rum"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Le","Old Cuban",{"cocktail":{"name":"Old Cuban","description":"$f","historical_reference":"Gary Regan's 'The Joy of Mixology' (2003 edition, with later revisions).

It's named after the Queen's Park Hotel in Port of Spain, Trinidad, where it originated in the early 20th century. This drink is more than just a mix of ingredients; it's a carefully balanced symphony of sweet, sour, and herbal notes, delivered with an invigorating chill. The Swizzle technique is crucial, as it chills the drink rapidly while aerating it, resulting in a frosty and flavorful experience. The use of aged rum adds depth and complexity, distinguishing it from simpler rum cocktails. Fresh mint is muddled gently to release its aromatic oils without becoming bitter. A dash of Angostura bitters provides a spicy, aromatic counterpoint to the sweetness of the sugar and the tartness of the lime. The Queen's Park Swizzle represents the epitome of tropical elegance, and has become a standard by which many other rum cocktails are measured.","historical_reference":"$10","technique":"1. Gently Muddle: In a highball glass, gently muddle the mint leaves with the simple syrup. Be careful not to over-muddle, as this can release bitter compounds. 2. Add Ingredients: Add the aged rum, lime juice, and Angostura bitters to the glass. 3. Fill with Crushed Ice: Fill the glass completely with crushed ice. 4. Swizzle: Insert a swizzle stick (or a long spoon) into the glass and swizzle vigorously, using a back-and-forth motion. The goal is to chill and aerate the drink simultaneously, creating a frosty effect. Continue swizzling until the glass is frosted on the outside. 5. Add More Ice: Add more crushed ice to form a cone above the rim of the glass. 6. Garnish: Garnish with a generous sprig of fresh mint.
