f:T4b6,The Incredible Hulk, also known as the Green-Eyed Monster, is a vibrant and potent cocktail known for its striking green hue and powerful flavor profile. This drink gained popularity in the early 2000s and is commonly attributed to celebrity endorsements. The cocktail is a relatively modern creation, deviating from classic cocktail recipes. It combines the sophistication of Cognac with the clean potency of vodka. It's designed to be visually appealing with a strong flavor that balances sweetness and booziness. The drink is named for its resemblance to the fictional superhero, emphasizing its powerful nature. While not a sophisticated cocktail in the traditional sense, it holds popularity in modern bars due to its simplicity and eye-catching appearance. It is often enjoyed in social settings due to its vibrant color and strong impact. Its simplicity makes it easy to reproduce even without extensive mixology skills. The flavor profile is aimed toward a sweeter taste, which appeals to a broad consumer segment. It is a relatively high-alcohol cocktail and is intended for responsible consumption. The drink is usually ordered based on its name and color rather than the complex flavor elements.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Hypnotiq"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Le","Incredible Hulk",{"cocktail":{"name":"Incredible Hulk","description":"$f","historical_reference":"Source not found","technique":"Fill a shaker with ice.
