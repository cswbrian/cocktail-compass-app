f:T43a,Fernet con Coca, or Fernet and Coke, is a popular highball cocktail, particularly in Argentina. It's a simple yet surprisingly complex drink where the bitter, herbaceous Fernet Branca is balanced by the sweetness and effervescence of Coca-Cola. The combination is unexpectedly refreshing, and the Fernet's menthol and spice notes cut through the sweetness of the cola. The drink's popularity in Argentina is legendary; it's often considered the national drink and is consumed in vast quantities, especially among younger generations. While the exact origins of the combination are unclear, its spread can be attributed to the local production of Fernet Branca and the widespread availability of Coca-Cola. It's become a social ritual, often enjoyed during 'previas' (pre-parties) or as a digestif after meals. The drink's appeal lies in its contrasting flavors that somehow complement each other, making it a unique and beloved beverage. The ratio of Fernet to Coke is a matter of personal preference, but a common starting point is around 30% Fernet to 70% Coke, adjusted to taste.10:T50a,The Long Island Iced Tea is a potent cocktail that, despite its name, contains no tea. Its creation is often attributed to Robert "Rosebud" Butt in 1972 at the Oak Beach Inn on Long Island, New York. Butt concocted the drink as an entry in a contest to create a new mixed drink using triple sec. The drink quickly gained popularity due to its deceivingly sweet taste, which masks its high alcohol content. The combination of multiple spirits makes it a strong drink, while the addition of cola gives it the appearance of iced tea. Today, the Long Island Iced Tea is a popular choice in bars and restaurants worldwide, known for its strength and its ability to deliver a considerable alcoholic punch. Variations of the drink exist, but the core components of vodka, gin, rum, tequila, triple sec, and a sour mix remain consistent. The Long Island Iced Tea is a testament to the art of mixology, where seemingly disparate ingredients can come together to create a uniquely palatable and potent beverage. It is often enjoyed during social gatherings, parties, and casual nights out. The drink's popularity has solidified its place as a modern classic in the world of cocktails. As an additional point, some modern variations use simple syrup instead of coca cola and a lemon wedge for garnish.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Coca-Cola"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Le","Fernet con Coca",{"cocktail":{"name":"Fernet con Coca","description":"$f","historical_reference":"Source not found","technique":"Fill a highball glass with ice.
