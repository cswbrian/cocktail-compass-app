f:T5c6,Leite de Onça, translating to 'Jaguar's Milk', is a creamy, potent Brazilian cocktail, that bridges the gap between a dessert drink and a strong, spirit-forward concoction. While its exact origins are murky, it's believed to have emerged from the vibrant bar scene of São Paulo, possibly as a playful twist on traditional Brazilian ingredients and flavors. The cocktail is known for its velvety texture, achieved through the blending of condensed milk and cream, which creates a rich canvas for the cachaça's spirituous punch. Egg yolks contribute additional creaminess and body, while chocolate powder adds a subtle hint of cocoa, balancing the sweetness and alcohol content. It is typically served chilled and garnished with grated chocolate, further enhancing its decadent appeal. Due to its high calorie and alcohol content, Leite de Onça is often enjoyed as an after-dinner drink or a special treat. Its name evokes a sense of exoticism and strength, reflecting both its Brazilian heritage and its powerful flavor profile. The cocktail's popularity has spread beyond Brazil, appealing to those seeking a unique and indulgent drinking experience. It is a testament to the creative ways that traditional ingredients can be transformed into innovative and memorable cocktails. The drink is enjoyed for its distinctive combination of sweetness, spirituous character, and creamy texture, making it a favorite among those with a sweet tooth and a penchant for strong flavors.10:T484,The Porto Flip is a classic cocktail dating back to the 17th century, a rich and decadent drink traditionally enjoyed as a nightcap. It's a fortified wine cocktail, showcasing the robust character of Port wine, enriched with egg yolk and a touch of sweetness. The egg yolk imparts a creamy texture and enhances the overall richness, while a grating of nutmeg provides a warm, aromatic finish. Flips, as a category, were originally made with beer, rum and sugar, heated with a hot poker, but eventually evolved into the egg-enriched, spirit-based drinks we know today. The Porto Flip remains a timeless example of a simple yet luxurious cocktail, perfect for cooler evenings or as an indulgent treat. Its simplicity highlights the quality of the ingredients, making it a favorite among those who appreciate both classic cocktails and the nuances of fortified wine. The combination of port, egg, and sugar creates a velvety smooth experience, leaving a lasting impression of comfort and sophistication. Variations may include adding a dash of brandy for extra strength or using different types of Port, such as Tawny, for a slightly different flavor profile.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":["Cocktails with ","Egg Yolk"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4","children":[["$","$Le","Flip",{"cocktail":{"name":"Flip","description":"The Flip is a classic cocktail with a rich history, dating back to the 17th century when it was a simple mixture of beer, rum, and sugar, heated with a hot iron poker.

Over time, the Flip evolved, with beer being replaced by stronger spirits like brandy or sherry, and the addition of egg yolk for a richer texture and flavor. Nutmeg became a standard garnish, adding a warm, aromatic touch. The Flip gained popularity in the 18th and 19th centuries, often served as a nightcap or a restorative drink. Today, it remains a beloved classic, appreciated for its comforting warmth and velvety texture. The combination of spirit, sweetener, and egg creates a luxurious, full-bodied drink, perfect for cold evenings.
