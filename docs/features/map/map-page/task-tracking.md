### **In Progress** 🔄

- [ ] **DEPRECATED**: Region concept is being phased out and will be removed
- [ ] Add region selector with places_by_region() integration (backend ready) - **DEPRECATED**
- [ ] Test user experience with empty initial state

### **Place Tags & Multi-Tag Filtering — Implementation Plan**

#### Backend/data
- [ ] Migration: `20250114_001_add_place_tags.sql`
  - `ALTER TABLE places ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS tags text[];`
  - `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_places_tags ON places USING GIN (tags);`
  - Backfill: derive from `place_types` using mapping; de-duplicate and lowercase
- [ ] RPCs: extend `places_in_viewport` and `nearby_places` with optional `filter_tags text[]` and `match text DEFAULT 'any'`
  - `any`: `p.tags && filter_tags`
  - `all`: `p.tags @> filter_tags`

#### Types & services
- [ ] `src/types/place.ts`: add `tags?: string[]`
- [ ] `src/types/map.ts`: extend `PlaceSearchParams` with `selectedTags?: string[]`, `matchMode?: 'any'|'all'`
- [ ] `src/services/map-service.ts`: pass `filter_tags` and `match` to RPCs

#### UI
- [ ] MapPage: tag chips control; persist to URL (`tags`, `match`) and session
- [ ] MapContainer: thread selected tags to data fetching
- [ ] PlaceBottomSheet: render tags as chips

#### i18n & analytics
- [ ] Add `matchAnyTags`, `matchAllTags`, `filterByTags`, `clearTags`
- [ ] Track `filter_tags_apply`, `filter_tags_clear`, `filter_match_mode_change`

#### QA
- [ ] Large selection of tags performs well (<500ms fetch)
- [ ] URL share reproduces selection
- [ ] Backfill creates stable tags for all existing places

### **City-Based Quick Zoom — Implementation Plan**

#### Configuration & data
- [ ] Extend `src/config/map-config.ts` with city definitions:
  ```typescript
  export const CITY_QUICK_ZOOM = {
    cities: [
      { name: 'Hong Kong', lat: 22.2849, lng: 114.1577, zoom: 16, country: 'HK' },
      { name: 'Taipei', lat: 25.0330, lng: 121.5654, zoom: 15, country: 'TW' },
      { name: 'Tainan', lat: 22.9997, lng: 120.2270, zoom: 15, country: 'TW' },
      { name: 'Kaohsiung', lat: 22.6273, lng: 120.3014, zoom: 15, country: 'TW' },
      { name: 'Tokyo', lat: 35.6762, lng: 139.6503, zoom: 14, country: 'JP' },
      { name: 'Bangkok', lat: 13.7563, lng: 100.5018, zoom: 14, country: 'TH' },
      { name: 'Chiang Mai', lat: 18.7883, lng: 98.9853, zoom: 15, country: 'TH' }
    ]
  } as const;
  ```

#### UI components
- [ ] Create `src/components/map/CitySelector.tsx`:
  - Dropdown trigger with globe icon and current city name
  - City list with country flags and distance indicators
  - Hover states and smooth transitions
  - Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- [ ] Add city selector to `MapContainer` left control stack (opposite side from location button)
- [ ] Position above filter chips to avoid overlap

#### Functionality
- [ ] Implement `handleCityJump(city)` function in `MapContainer`:
  - Use `mapRef.current.flyTo()` for smooth transitions
  - Update URL state with city parameter
  - Trigger viewport change for data loading
  - Track analytics event
- [ ] Update URL state management to include `?city=hong-kong` parameter
- [ ] Session persistence for last selected city
- [ ] Integration with existing viewport-based data loading

#### i18n & analytics
- [ ] Add translation keys: `quickJump`, `selectCity`, city names in multiple languages
- [ ] Track events: `city_jump_[city_name]`, `city_selector_open`
- [ ] Support for English, Chinese, Thai, Japanese city names

#### QA
- [ ] Smooth transitions between cities (<1s animation)
- [ ] URL state correctly reflects selected city
- [ ] Session persistence works across browser refresh
- [ ] Mobile and desktop responsive design
- [ ] No interference with existing map controls

### **Open Now Filter & Status — Implementation Plan**

#### Backend/data
- [ ] Create timezone-aware SQL function `is_open_now(opening_hours jsonb, tz text)` that parses `periods[]` and compares against local time; handle same-day and overnight ranges; return null when unknown
- [ ] Update `places_in_viewport` to return `is_open_now(p.opening_hours, p.timezone) as is_open`
- [ ] Update `nearby_places` to return `is_open_now(p.opening_hours, p.timezone) as is_open`
- [ ] Create a new migration to drop STORED column `places.is_open` (status must be computed dynamically)
- [ ] Update `supabase/migrations/apply-to-production.sh` if needed to include the new migration
- [ ] Validate all seed rows have `opening_hours` where available; allow nulls gracefully

#### Types
- [ ] Extend `Place` to include optional `is_open?: boolean | null` and `opening_hours?: any`
- [ ] Ensure `PlaceMarker` inherits `is_open` for map consumption

#### Services
- [ ] No change to RPC call signatures; ensure responses are passed through intact in `map-service`

#### UI & state
- [ ] Reuse `PlaceStatusDisplay` in `PlaceBottomSheet` (already integrated) and any list/card
- [ ] Add a floating "Open Now" toggle button in `MapContainer` control stack (right side)
- [ ] Manage filter state in `MapPage` with URL param `open=1` and session persistence
- [ ] When enabled, filter `displayPlaces` client-side to `p.is_open === true`
- [ ] Update top-center count banner to reflect filtered counts and context
- [ ] Track GA events: `filter_open_now_on`, `filter_open_now_off`

#### i18n
- [ ] Add translation keys: `openNow`, `openPlacesCount`, `allPlacesCount`

#### QA
- [ ] No `opening_hours` → status hidden; place still included when filter off
- [ ] `is_open = null` → excluded only when filter is on
- [ ] Behavior across viewport changes preserves filter
- [ ] URL share retains filter state

### **Pending Tasks** ⏳

- [ ] Add advanced filtering (price, rating, open/closed status)
- [ ] Implement search functionality
- [ ] Add place categories/tags
- [ ] Implement place recommendations
- [ ] Add user reviews and ratings
- [ ] Implement place verification system
- [ ] Add analytics and usage tracking

### **Technical Notes**

- **Region Concept**: The region concept (Hong Kong/Taiwan) is being deprecated and will be removed in future versions
- **Smart Default Viewport**: Replaces region-based initialization with intelligent fallback data loading
- **PostGIS Functions**: All spatial queries now use viewport-based functions instead of region-based ones
- **Backward Compatibility**: Region-based functions still exist but are deprecated and will be removed
