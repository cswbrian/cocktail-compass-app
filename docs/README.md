## 🛠️ Adding New Features

When adding new features, follow this structure:

1. **Create Feature Directory**: `docs/features/[feature-name]/`
2. **Use Template Structure**:
   ```
   docs/features/[feature-name]/
   ├── README.md           # Feature overview
   ├── prd.md              # Product requirements
   ├── implementation.md   # Technical details
