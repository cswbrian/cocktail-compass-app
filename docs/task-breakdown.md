# Cocktail Bar Map - Implementation Plan

## ðŸ“ˆ Status: âœ… Day 2 Complete â†’ Ready for Day 3

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Plan (3-4 days)

### Day 1: Foundation âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Install dependencies (leaflet, react-leaflet, @types/leaflet)
- [x] Create map types and Supabase service integrations
- [x] Build PWA GeolocationService with permission handling
- [x] Build optimized MapContainer with viewport loading
- [x] Add protected map route (/:language/map) with RequireUsername wrapper
- [x] Add Map to bottom navigation for authenticated users
- [x] Implement SWR caching for place data
- [x] Create PostGIS functions (places_in_viewport, nearby_places, places_by_region)
- [x] Fix map initialization and Leaflet errors
- [x] Configure Hong Kong Central as default center (22.2849, 114.1577)
- [x] Set zoom level to 16 for detailed street view
- [x] Implement 1km radius for nearby places
- [x] Create migration files for production deployment

### Day 2: Core Map âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Implement lazy-rendered place markers with clustering
- [x] Build bottom sheet popover with place details
- [x] Add swipeable place navigation carousel
- [x] Integrate PostGIS Supabase functions (places_in_viewport)
- [x] Implement debounced map event handlers
- [x] Enhanced UX: Remove loading popups, smooth transitions
- [x] Unified navigation: Bottom sheet with swipe/button navigation
- [x] Clean map interactions: No dark overlay, center-on-click
- [x] Synchronized navigation: Map centers and markers update on left/right navigation
- [x] Proper layout: Fixed map height to fit between header and bottom nav
- [x] Immersive fullscreen: Transparent header overlay with backdrop blur
- [x] Full map coverage: Map occupies entire screen area behind header
- [x] URL state management: Map center, zoom, and selected marker persist in URL
- [x] State restoration: Map state preserved across navigation and refresh

### Day 3: PWA & UX Features  
- [ ] Add region selector with places_by_region() integration
- [ ] Implement PWA geolocation with nearby_places() function
- [ ] Handle geolocation permissions and fallback states
- [ ] Add "Near Me" functionality with GPS integration
- [ ] Mobile optimization (touch controls, responsive markers)
- [ ] Error handling and loading states

### Day 4: Polish & Testing
- [ ] Test authentication flow and route protection
- [ ] Performance optimization and bundle analysis
- [ ] Cross-device testing (authenticated users)
- [ ] Accessibility check
- [ ] Launch preparation and documentation
