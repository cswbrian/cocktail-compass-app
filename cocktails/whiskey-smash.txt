e:T437,The Whiskey Smash is a refreshing and adaptable cocktail with roots in the 19th century. It's essentially a whiskey-based sour with the addition of muddled mint and seasonal fruit, offering a vibrant and aromatic experience. Its simplicity allows for easy customization; different fruits, herbs, and sweeteners can be used to create variations that suit individual tastes. The drink is often served over crushed ice, which further enhances its cooling qualities, making it a popular choice for warm weather. Its historical significance lies in its representation of early American cocktail culture, where fresh ingredients were combined with spirits to create flavorful and accessible drinks. The Whiskey Smash exemplifies this tradition, offering a balanced blend of sweetness, tartness, and herbal notes that continues to appeal to modern palates. The versatility of the Smash also means it has evolved over time, with bartenders experimenting with different types of whiskey, fruits, and sweeteners to create unique variations while maintaining the core elements of the drink.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"Whiskey Smash"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-6","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Flavor Notes"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap gap-2","children":[["$","span","0",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Fruity"}],["$","span","1",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Citrus"}],["$","span","2",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Herbal"}],["$","span","3",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Woody"}],["$","span","4",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Grassy"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Bourbon",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[60," ","ml"]}]]}]],[],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Mint Leaves",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[8," ","leaves"]}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Simple Syrup",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[15," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","2",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Lemon Wedges",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[30," ","ml"]}]]}]]]}]]}],["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","Mint sprig and a citrus wedge or wheel (e.g., lemon, orange)"]}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Instructions"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-300","children":"1.
