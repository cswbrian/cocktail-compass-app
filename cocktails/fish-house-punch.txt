11:T47c,Fish House Punch is a potent and historic American punch, traditionally associated with the State in Schuylkill fishing club near Philadelphia. Its exact origins are somewhat murky, but it's believed to date back to the early 18th century, possibly even earlier. The club, known for its convivial gatherings and dedication to angling, is credited with creating and popularizing the punch. The original recipe was a closely guarded secret, passed down through generations of club members. Over time, variations emerged, but the core components remained consistent: rum, cognac, peach brandy, citrus, and sugar. The punch was often served at elaborate feasts and social events hosted by the club, becoming a symbol of hospitality and camaraderie. Its reputation spread throughout the colonies and eventually across the United States. Fish House Punch is more than just a cocktail; it's a piece of American history, a testament to the traditions of early American social clubs and their contribution to the development of cocktail culture. Its enduring appeal lies in its complex flavor profile and its ability to bring people together in celebration.7:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"Fish House Punch"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-6","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Flavor Notes"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap gap-2","children":[["$","$Lf","0",{"href":"/flavours/fruity","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Fruity"}],["$","$Lf","1",{"href":"/flavours/citrus","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Citrus"}],["$","$Lf","2",{"href":"/flavours/tropical","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Tropical"}],["$","$Lf","3",{"href":"/flavours/woody","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Woody"}],["$","$Lf","4",{"href":"/flavours/spicy","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Spicy"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-8","children":["$","$L10",null,{"flavorProfile":{"body":7,"booziness":7,"bubbles":false,"complexity":8,"sourness":6,"sweetness":5}}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":[["$","$Lf",null,{"href":"/ingredients/dark-jamaican-rum","className":"hover:text-blue-400 transition-colors","children":"Dark Jamaican Rum"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[250," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":[["$","$Lf",null,{"href":"/ingredients/cognac","className":"hover:text-blue-400 transition-colors","children":"Cognac"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[250," ","ml"]}]]}]],[],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Peach Brandy",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[250," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Lemon Juice",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[375," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","2",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Simple Syrup (1:1)",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[250," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","3",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Water",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[750," ","ml"]}]]}]]]}]]}],["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","Lemon slices and/or grated nutmeg floated on top."]}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Instructions"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-300","children":"Combine all ingredients in a large punch bowl.
