11:T48c,The Cosmopolitan, often shortened to "Cosmo," is a classic cocktail known for its vibrant pink hue and refreshing taste. Though its exact origins are debated, the modern version is widely attributed to Cheryl Cook at the Strand Restaurant in South Beach, Florida, in the mid-1980s. Cook's intention was to create a visually appealing drink served in a Martini glass that was more palatable than the overly sweet drinks of the time. Toby Cecchini, of The Odeon in New York City, is also often credited with popularizing a version of the Cosmo. However, the cocktail gained massive popularity in the 1990s, largely due to its frequent appearance on the television show "Sex and the City," where it became the signature drink of the character Carrie Bradshaw and her friends. The Cosmo's appeal lies in its balance of sweet, tart, and slightly citrusy flavors, making it a sophisticated and approachable choice for cocktail enthusiasts. Its simple recipe and readily available ingredients have further cemented its status as a modern classic, frequently found on cocktail menus worldwide. The drink is not too strong, and perfect for a celebration or a special treat.7:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"Cosmopolitan"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-6","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Flavor Notes"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap gap-2","children":[["$","$Lf","0",{"href":"/flavours/fruity","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Fruity"}],["$","$Lf","1",{"href":"/flavours/citrus","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Citrus"}],["$","$Lf","2",{"href":"/flavours/sour","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Sour"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-8","children":["$","$L10",null,{"flavorProfile":{"body":4,"booziness":4,"bubbles":false,"complexity":6,"sourness":7,"sweetness":6}}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":[["$","$Lf",null,{"href":"/ingredients/vodka","className":"hover:text-blue-400 transition-colors","children":"Vodka"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[45," ","ml"]}]]}]],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Orange Liqueur (e.g., Cointreau)",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[15," ","ml"]}]]}]],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Cranberry Juice",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[30," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Lime Juice",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[15," ","ml"]}]]}]]]}]]}],["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","Orange peel, expressed and placed on the rim."]}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Instructions"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-300","children":"Chill a coupe or martini glass.
