d:T4e8,The Cosmopolitan, often shortened to "Cosmo", is a classic cocktail known for its vibrant pink color and refreshing tartness. It gained significant popularity in the 1990s, largely due to its association with the television show "Sex and the City". However, its origins predate the show, with variations appearing as early as the 1930s. The modern Cosmopolitan is often attributed to bartender Cheryl Cook, who created it in South Beach, Florida, in the mid-1980s. Her goal was to create a visually appealing and palatable drink for the martini-drinking crowd, using Absolut Citron vodka, a splash of cranberry juice, a dash of Rose's lime juice, and Cointreau. Another claim for the Cosmo's invention is by Toby Cecchini from The Odeon restaurant in New York City, who made it in 1988/1989 using similar ingredients, but emphasizing fresh lime juice over Rose's lime. The drinkâ€™s balance of sweet, sour, and slightly bitter elements makes it a versatile and approachable choice. While recipes may vary slightly, the key components remain consistent: vodka (often citrus-flavored), cranberry juice, lime juice, and orange liqueur. Its enduring appeal lies in its simplicity, elegance, and refreshing taste, making it a staple on cocktail menus worldwide.5:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-8","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"Cosmopolitan"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Citrus Vodka",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[45," ","ml"]}]]}]],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Orange Liqueur (Cointreau)",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[7," ","ml"]}]]}]],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Cranberry Juice",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[30," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Fresh Lime Juice",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[15," ","ml"]}]]}]]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-6","children":["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","Orange peel, expressed and placed on the rim of the glass."]}]}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Instructions"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-300","children":"Chill a coupe or martini glass.
