10:T497,The Clover Club is a classic pre-Prohibition cocktail that originated at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia. It was named after the Clover Club Society, a group of lawyers, writers, and other professionals who met in the hotel's bar. The drink gained popularity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and was known for its delicate balance of sweet, sour, and slightly tart flavors, along with its distinctive foamy texture from the egg white. While the Clover Club's popularity waned after Prohibition, it has experienced a resurgence in recent years thanks to the renewed interest in classic cocktails. Modern mixologists appreciate its elegant simplicity and the opportunity to showcase high-quality ingredients. The cocktail represents a piece of cocktail history, a time when drinks were crafted with fresh ingredients and attention to detail. Its balanced profile and attractive appearance make it a favorite among those who appreciate sophisticated and flavorful concoctions. The Clover Club is a testament to the enduring appeal of well-made cocktails that stand the test of time, offering a glimpse into the past while remaining relevant in the present.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"Clover Club"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-6","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Flavor Notes"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap gap-2","children":[["$","$Le","0",{"href":"/flavours/fruity","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Fruity"}],["$","$Le","1",{"href":"/flavours/citrus","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Citrus"}],["$","$Le","2",{"href":"/flavours/floral","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Floral"}],["$","$Le","3",{"href":"/flavours/sour","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Sour"}],["$","$Le","4",{"href":"/flavours/sweet","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Sweet"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-8","children":["$","$Lf",null,{"flavorProfile":{"body":5,"booziness":4,"bubbles":false,"complexity":7,"sourness":7,"sweetness":5}}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":[["$","$Le",null,{"href":"/ingredients/gin","className":"hover:text-blue-400 transition-colors","children":"Gin"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[45," ","ml"]}]]}]],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Raspberry Syrup",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[15," ","ml"]}]]}]],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Lemon Juice",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[22," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Egg White",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[15," ","ml"]}]]}]]]}]]}],["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","Three fresh raspberries, skewered."]}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Instructions"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-300","children":"1.
