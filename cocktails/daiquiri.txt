d:T476,The Daiquiri is a classic cocktail with a history as bright and refreshing as its taste. It's believed to have originated in Cuba, around the turn of the 20th century, near a mining town called Daiquiri. The drink is often attributed to an American mining engineer named Jennings Cox, who reportedly invented it as a simple way to serve rum to guests. Cox supposedly named the drink after the nearby Daiquiri mines. Another account credits Emilio 'Maragato' Gonzalez, a bartender in Santiago, as the creator. Regardless of its precise origin, the Daiquiri quickly gained popularity due to its simplicity and use of readily available ingredients. It further rose to prominence thanks to figures like Ernest Hemingway and President John F. Kennedy, who were both known to enjoy the drink. Over time, the Daiquiri has become a staple in bars around the world, revered for its balanced flavor and adaptability. It serves as a canvas for experimentation, with countless variations incorporating different fruits and flavors. Despite these variations, the classic Daiquiri remains a timeless testament to the power of simplicity in cocktail making.5:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-8","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"Daiquiri"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["White Rum",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[60," ","ml"]}]]}]],[],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Fresh Lime Juice",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[30," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Simple Syrup",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[22," ","ml"]}]]}]]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-6","children":["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","Lime wheel or wedge"]}]}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Instructions"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-300","children":"Chill a coupe or cocktail glass.
