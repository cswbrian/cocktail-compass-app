e:T516,The Blue Hawaiian is a tropical cocktail that embodies the spirit of the islands with its vibrant color and fruity flavors. It is a variation of the Piña Colada, distinguished by the addition of blue curaçao, which imparts both its striking hue and a subtle orange flavor. The drink is traditionally made with white rum, vodka, pineapple juice, cream of coconut, and blue curaçao. Served over ice, it offers a refreshing and visually appealing experience, making it a popular choice for vacationers and those seeking a taste of paradise. The precise origin of the Blue Hawaiian is somewhat debated, but it is generally believed to have emerged in the mid-20th century, likely coinciding with the increasing popularity of Hawaiian-themed bars and restaurants. Its success can be attributed to its balance of sweet and fruity notes, combined with its eye-catching presentation. The Blue Hawaiian quickly became a staple of poolside bars and luaus, solidifying its place in cocktail culture as a symbol of relaxation and tropical indulgence. While it may not be the most complex or sophisticated cocktail, its simplicity and crowd-pleasing flavors have ensured its enduring appeal. The drink perfectly encapsulates the escapist allure of a tropical getaway, offering a taste of the exotic in every sip.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"Blue Hawaiian"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-6","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Flavor Notes"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap gap-2","children":[["$","span","0",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Fruity"}],["$","span","1",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Tropical"}],["$","span","2",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Sweet"}],["$","span","3",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Citrus"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["White Rum",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[30," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Vodka",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[30," ","ml"]}]]}]],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Blue Curaçao",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[30," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Cream of Coconut",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[30," ","ml"]}]]}]],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Pineapple Juice",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[90," ","ml"]}]]}]]]}]]}],["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","Pineapple wedge and a maraschino cherry"]}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Instructions"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-300","children":"Add all ingredients to a blender with 1 cup of ice.
