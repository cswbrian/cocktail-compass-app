f:T669,The Last Word is a pre-Prohibition era cocktail that has enjoyed a remarkable resurgence in popularity since the early 2000s. Its exact origins are somewhat debated, but it is most commonly attributed to the Detroit Athletic Club, where it was supposedly created by a vaudeville performer named Frank Fogarty sometime around 1915. The original recipe called for equal parts gin, green Chartreuse, maraschino liqueur, and lime juice, a seemingly unusual combination that somehow works in perfect harmony. For decades, the Last Word faded into obscurity, rarely appearing on cocktail menus. However, in the early 2000s, Seattle bartender Murray Stenson rediscovered the drink while researching vintage cocktail books. He added it to the menu at the Zig Zag Cafe, where it quickly gained a cult following among cocktail enthusiasts. From there, its popularity spread to bars around the world, cementing its status as a modern classic. The Last Word is prized for its unique balance of sweet, sour, herbal, and subtly bitter flavors. The gin provides a botanical base, the green Chartreuse contributes complex herbal notes and a touch of sweetness, the maraschino liqueur adds a cherry-almond aroma, and the fresh lime juice provides the necessary acidity to tie everything together. Its equal-parts construction makes it easy to remember and reproduce, further contributing to its appeal. Today, the Last Word is considered one of the most important and influential cocktails of the modern era, inspiring countless variations and adaptations. Its enduring popularity is a testament to its perfectly balanced flavor profile and its rich history.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"The Last Word"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-6","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Flavor Notes"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap gap-2","children":[["$","$Le","0",{"href":"/flavours/herbal","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Herbal"}],["$","$Le","1",{"href":"/flavours/citrus","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Citrus"}],["$","$Le","2",{"href":"/flavours/fruity","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Fruity"}],["$","$Le","3",{"href":"/flavours/bitter","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Bitter"}],["$","$Le","4",{"href":"/flavours/floral","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Floral"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":[["$","$Le",null,{"href":"/ingredients/gin","className":"hover:text-blue-400 transition-colors","children":"Gin"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[22," ","ml"]}]]}]],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Green Chartreuse",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[22," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Maraschino Liqueur",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[22," ","ml"]}]]}]],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Lime Juice",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[22," ","ml"]}]]}]]]}]]}],["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","Brandied cherry or lime wedge.
