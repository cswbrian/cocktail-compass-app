d:T487,The Whiskey Sour is a foundational cocktail, balancing the strength of whiskey with the tartness of lemon juice and the sweetness of sugar. Its exact origins are debated, but it likely evolved from grog-like concoctions enjoyed by sailors in the 19th century, who mixed spirits with citrus to prevent scurvy. The addition of egg white, while optional, creates a silky texture and a frothy top, enhancing the overall experience. Whiskey Sours gained popularity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, becoming a staple in bars worldwide. Variations abound, with different types of whiskey used, and some recipes incorporating bitters or other flavorings. The Whiskey Sour remains a beloved classic due to its simple yet satisfying combination of flavors and its adaptability to personal preferences. The use of fresh ingredients is crucial for achieving the optimal balance and brightness. The egg white, if used, should be fresh and properly emulsified to avoid any unpleasant texture or aroma. The balance of sweet and sour is key and should be adjusted to taste. The Whiskey Sour is a testament to the enduring appeal of well-crafted, balanced cocktails.5:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-8","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"Whiskey Sour"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Bourbon Whiskey",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[60," ","ml"]}]]}]],[],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Fresh Lemon Juice",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[30," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Simple Syrup",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[22," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","2",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Egg White",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[30," ","ml"]}]]}]]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-6","children":["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","Orange peel and a maraschino cherry.
