d:T460,The Revolving Door is a modern classic cocktail known for its complex yet balanced flavor profile. It masterfully combines the robust character of bourbon with the nuanced sweetness of maple syrup and the herbal and citrusy elements of vermouth and orange bitters. The name itself suggests the revolving door of flavors that dance on the palate. This cocktail offers a sophisticated drinking experience, appealing to those who appreciate a well-crafted and thoughtfully composed beverage. It's a drink that invites contemplation and rewards the drinker with its evolving layers of taste. The careful selection of ingredients ensures a harmonious blend, where no single element overpowers the others. Instead, they work together to create a cohesive and memorable cocktail that is both approachable and intriguing. While the Revolving Door may not have a long history, its creation reflects the modern mixology movement's emphasis on quality ingredients and innovative flavor combinations. It's a cocktail designed to be savored, a perfect choice for an evening of relaxed conversation or a moment of personal indulgence.5:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-8","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"Revolving Door"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Bourbon",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[45," ","ml"]}]]}]],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Sweet Vermouth",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[22," ","ml"]}]]}]],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Maple Syrup",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[15," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Orange Bitters",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[2," ","dashes"]}]]}]]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-6","children":["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","Orange peel, expressed and placed in the glass."]}]}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Instructions"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-300","children":"Combine all ingredients in a mixing glass with ice.
