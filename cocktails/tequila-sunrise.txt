d:T567,The Tequila Sunrise is a vibrant and visually appealing cocktail known for its layered appearance reminiscent of a sunrise. Its origins can be traced back to the early 1970s, with different claims of origin from Acapulco to Arizona. One popular story attributes its creation to Gene Sulit at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel, who crafted it for a regular customer who wanted something refreshing and easy to drink. The original version included tequila, lime juice, cr√®me de cassis, and soda water. However, the more widely recognized recipe featuring orange juice and grenadine gained popularity later. The Rolling Stones are often associated with popularizing the drink after Mick Jagger sampled it during a private party in 1972 and began requesting it on their tour. The Tequila Sunrise is a relatively simple drink to prepare, typically built directly in a glass over ice. The grenadine, being denser, settles at the bottom, creating the sunrise effect as it gradually rises and mixes with the orange juice. Its sweet and fruity flavor profile makes it a popular choice for casual occasions, brunches, and hot weather. The cocktail's enduring appeal lies in its attractive appearance, approachable taste, and ease of preparation. While it might not be considered a sophisticated cocktail, it remains a beloved classic enjoyed by many for its nostalgic charm and refreshing qualities.5:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-8","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"Tequila Sunrise"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Tequila",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[45," ","ml"]}]]}]],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Grenadine",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[15," ","ml"]}]]}]],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Orange Juice",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[90," ","ml"]}]]}]]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-6","children":["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","Orange slice and/or maraschino cherry.
