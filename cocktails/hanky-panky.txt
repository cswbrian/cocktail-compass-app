d:T487,The Hanky Panky, a classic cocktail invented by Ada 'Coley' Coleman, head bartender at the American Bar at the Savoy Hotel in London, around the early 1900s, is a sophisticated and complex drink. It's a variation on the Martini, but with the addition of sweet vermouth and a few dashes of Fernet-Branca, giving it a bitter, herbal edge that distinguishes it from its predecessor. Coleman was one of the few female bartenders of her time, and her creation quickly gained popularity among patrons of the Savoy. The name 'Hanky Panky' supposedly came from Coleman's exclamation upon tasting the finished cocktail, declaring it 'the real hanky-panky!' The drink is stirred, not shaken, to maintain its smooth texture, and served in a chilled cocktail glass. The interplay of the gin, vermouth, and Fernet-Branca creates a unique flavor profile, balancing the botanical notes of the gin with the sweet, slightly spicy vermouth and the intensely bitter and herbaceous Fernet-Branca. The orange zest garnish adds a bright, citrusy aroma, enhancing the overall experience of the cocktail. Its creation at such a prestigious bar cemented its place in cocktail history.5:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-8","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"Hanky Panky"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Gin",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[45," ","ml"]}]]}]],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Sweet Vermouth",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[22," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Fernet-Branca",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[2," ","ml"]}]]}]],[]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-6","children":["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","Orange zest, expressed over the drink and then dropped into the glass."]}]}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Instructions"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-300","children":"Chill a cocktail glass.
