d:T51d,The Death in the Afternoon, also known as the Hemingway Champagne, is a potent and effervescent cocktail created by Ernest Hemingway. Its simple yet striking combination of absinthe and Champagne delivers a unique sensory experience. The cocktail's invention is attributed to Hemingway, who included the recipe in a collection of celebrity cocktail recipes published in 1935. The name itself reflects Hemingway's characteristic dark humor and appreciation for strong, straightforward drinks. The preparation is exceptionally simple: absinthe is poured into a Champagne flute and then topped with Champagne. The drink should then be stirred gently until it obtains an opalescent cloudiness, creating a visually appealing effect. The result is a drink that is both refreshing and intensely flavored. The anise notes of the absinthe are balanced by the dryness and bubbles of the Champagne, creating a surprisingly harmonious blend. Despite its simplicity, the Death in the Afternoon is not for the faint of heart due to its high alcohol content. Itâ€™s best enjoyed slowly, allowing the flavors to fully develop on the palate. This cocktail remains a favorite among those seeking a bold and distinctive drinking experience, embodying Hemingway's adventurous spirit and appreciation for the finer things in life.5:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-8","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"Death in the Afternoon"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Absinthe",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[45," ","ml"]}]]}]],[],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Champagne",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[120," ","ml"]}]]}]]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-6","children":["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","None typically, though a lemon twist is sometimes used as a modern addition."]}]}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Instructions"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-300","children":"Pour absinthe into a Champagne flute.
