d:T4f8,The Penicillin cocktail, created by Sam Ross at Milk & Honey in New York City in 2005, is a modern classic celebrated for its unique blend of sweet, sour, spicy, and smoky flavors. It features a base of blended Scotch whisky, providing a smooth and approachable foundation, complemented by fresh lemon juice and a honey-ginger syrup that contributes both sweetness and a spicy kick. A float of heavily peated Scotch whisky is then added to create a striking contrast and aromatic complexity. The drinkâ€™s name reflects its perceived medicinal qualities due to the ginger and honey, often used as remedies for colds. The Penicillin is a testament to the art of balancing contrasting flavors, offering a sophisticated and comforting experience. Its popularity has made it a staple in cocktail bars worldwide, inspiring numerous variations while maintaining the integrity of its original concept. The use of both blended and peated Scotch showcases the range of flavors within the whisky category, and the careful balance of sweet, sour, and spicy elements demonstrates a masterful understanding of cocktail construction. The presentation, often served over a large ice cube, further enhances the drinking experience, allowing the flavors to meld gradually as the ice melts.5:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"Penicillin"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-6","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Flavor Notes"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap gap-2","children":[["$","span","0",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Smoky"}],["$","span","1",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Spicy"}],["$","span","2",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Citrus"}],["$","span","3",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Sweet"}],["$","span","4",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Herbal"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Blended Scotch Whisky",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[60," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Peated Scotch Whisky",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[7," ","ml"]}]]}]],[],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Lemon Juice",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[22," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Honey-Ginger Syrup",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[22," ","ml"]}]]}]]]}]]}],["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","Candied ginger piece"]}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Instructions"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-300","children":"Combine blended Scotch whisky, lemon juice, and honey-ginger syrup in a shaker with ice.
