e:T4d4,The Jack Rose is a classic cocktail dating back to the early 20th century. Its distinctive pink hue comes from grenadine, which balances the tartness of the apple brandy and lemon juice. The cocktail gained popularity in the pre-Prohibition era and was a favorite at establishments like the Knickerbocker Hotel in New York. There are varied origin stories, with some linking it to a bartender named Frank J. Rose, while others suggest it's named after a notorious gangster called 'Bald Jack' Rose. Regardless of its specific origin, the Jack Rose remains a well-regarded cocktail for its balance and refreshing character. The balance between sweet, sour, and the underlying apple notes makes the drink simultaneously approachable and complex. It fell out of favor for a time but has seen a resurgence in popularity with the revival of classic cocktails. Modern variations exist, but the classic recipe continues to be a benchmark for apple brandy cocktails. Using high-quality apple brandy is crucial for achieving the desired flavor profile. The quality of the grenadine also significantly impacts the overall taste and color of the drink. A well-made Jack Rose is a testament to the timeless appeal of simple, well-balanced cocktails.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"Jack Rose"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-6","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Flavor Notes"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap gap-2","children":[["$","span","0",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Fruity"}],["$","span","1",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Citrus"}],["$","span","2",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Sweet"}],["$","span","3",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Sour"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Apple Brandy",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[60," ","ml"]}]]}]],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Grenadine",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[15," ","ml"]}]]}]],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Lemon Juice",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[22," ","ml"]}]]}]]]}]]}],["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","Apple slice or a lemon twist"]}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Instructions"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-300","children":"Combine all ingredients in a shaker with ice.
