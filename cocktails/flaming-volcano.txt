e:T464,The Flaming Volcano is a potent and visually stunning tiki cocktail, typically served in a communal bowl designed to resemble a volcano. Its origins are often attributed to tiki bars of the mid-20th century, like Don the Beachcomber or Trader Vic's, although a definitive origin story remains elusive. The drink is characterized by its blend of multiple rums, brandy, and tropical fruit juices, resulting in a sweet, strong, and complex flavor profile. The 'flaming' aspect is achieved by soaking a sugar cube in high-proof alcohol and setting it alight, creating a dramatic and theatrical presentation. This cocktail is meant for sharing and embodies the spirit of tiki culture: exotic flavors, strong spirits, and a sense of convivial celebration. It's often served with long straws, encouraging guests to partake together in this fiery concoction. The flaming element is a key part of the experience, adding warmth and visual appeal, while the combination of sweet and strong elements makes it a memorable and potent drink. The Flaming Volcano exemplifies the escapism and adventure that tiki cocktails sought to provide.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"Flaming Volcano"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-6","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Flavor Notes"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap gap-2","children":[["$","span","0",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Tropical"}],["$","span","1",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Fruity"}],["$","span","2",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Sweet"}],["$","span","3",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Spicy"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Light Rum",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[60," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Dark Rum",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[30," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","2",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Brandy",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[30," ","ml"]}]]}]],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Orgeat Syrup",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[15," ","ml"]}]]}]],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Pineapple Juice",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[60," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Orange Juice",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[30," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","2",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Lime Juice",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[15," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","3",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Sugar Cube",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[1," ","pc"]}]]}]]]}]]}],["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","Pineapple wedge, cherry, and a flaming sugar cube soaked in high-proof rum.
