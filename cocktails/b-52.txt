e:T465,The B-52 is a layered cocktail composed of coffee liqueur, Irish cream, and orange liqueur. When properly prepared, the ingredients remain separated into three distinct layers, creating a visually appealing drink. Its origins are somewhat murky, with claims attributing its creation to various bartenders in different locations. One popular story suggests that it was invented by Peter Fich, a bartender at the Banff Springs Hotel in Alberta, Canada, in 1977. The name is believed to be a reference to the B-52 Stratofortress bomber, which was a symbol of American military might during the Cold War. The cocktail gained popularity in the late 1970s and early 1980s, becoming a staple at bars and nightclubs worldwide. Its sweet and creamy flavor profile makes it a popular choice for after-dinner drinks or for those who enjoy dessert-like cocktails. The B-52 is often served as a shooter, but it can also be enjoyed sipped slowly to appreciate the different layers of flavor. Variations of the B-52 exist, with some bartenders adding a fourth layer of Grand Marnier or other liqueurs to enhance the complexity of the drink.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"B-52"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-6","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Flavor Notes"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap gap-2","children":[["$","span","0",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Coffee"}],["$","span","1",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Chocolate"}],["$","span","2",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Creamy"}],["$","span","3",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Citrus"}],["$","span","4",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Vanilla"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Coffee Liqueur",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[20," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Irish Cream",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[20," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","2",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Orange Liqueur",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[20," ","ml"]}]]}]],[]]}]]}],["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","None typically, can be flamed for visual effect (optional)"]}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Instructions"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-300","children":"Carefully layer the ingredients in a shot glass using the back of a spoon to prevent mixing.
