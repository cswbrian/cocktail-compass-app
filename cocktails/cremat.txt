10:T441,1. In a heat-resistant earthenware bowl or pot, combine the rum, sugar, lemon peel, orange peel, coffee beans, and cinnamon stick.
2. Stir the mixture gently to dissolve some of the sugar.
3. Carefully heat the rum mixture, either on a stovetop or using a heat source under the bowl. Ensure it doesn't boil.
4. Using a ladle, scoop some of the heated rum and pour it back over the sugar and spices. This helps to dissolve the sugar further and infuse the flavors.
5. Once the sugar is mostly dissolved, carefully ignite the surface of the rum with a long match or lighter. The alcohol fumes will catch fire and burn with a blue flame.
6. Allow the rum to burn for a few minutes, stirring occasionally with a ladle. The longer it burns, the more alcohol evaporates, reducing the overall booziness.
7. Extinguish the flames by covering the bowl with a lid or by carefully adding a small amount of water or coffee.
8. Ladle the Cremat into heat-resistant glasses or mugs, ensuring that each serving contains a portion of the citrus peels and coffee beans.
9. Serve immediately and enjoy warm.11:T4a1,Cremat is a traditional hot alcoholic beverage from the Pyrenees mountains, typically consumed in Catalonia, Andorra, and parts of Southern France. Its roots are deeply intertwined with mountain culture, folklore, and communal gatherings. Historically, it was prepared during winter festivals, celebrations, or simply as a way to ward off the cold in the harsh mountain environment. The precise origins are obscure, evolving as a homebrew tradition. Recipes were passed down through generations, with regional variations emerging, reflecting the availability of local ingredients and personal preferences. The burning ritual before consumption is a symbolic act, thought to purify the drink and strengthen bonds among those sharing it. The act of flambéing the alcohol creates a visually stunning effect, adding to the drink's cultural significance and making it more than just a simple beverage. Today, Cremat continues to be a popular drink at festivals, ski resorts, and private gatherings in the Pyrenees, preserving a taste of the region's rich heritage. It is not merely a beverage; it is a cultural experience that connects people to the history and traditions of the Pyrenees.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"Cremat"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-6","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Flavor Notes"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap gap-2","children":[["$","$Le","0",{"href":"/flavours/citrus","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Citrus"}],["$","$Le","1",{"href":"/flavours/spicy","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Spicy"}],["$","$Le","2",{"href":"/flavours/fruity","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Fruity"}],["$","$Le","3",{"href":"/flavours/nutty","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Nutty"}],["$","$Le","4",{"href":"/flavours/woody","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Woody"}],["$","$Le","5",{"href":"/flavours/smoky","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Smoky"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-8","children":["$","$Lf",null,{"flavorProfile":{"body":6,"booziness":6,"bubbles":false,"complexity":7,"sourness":3,"sweetness":7}}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":[["$","$Le",null,{"href":"/ingredients/rum","className":"hover:text-blue-400 transition-colors","children":"Rum"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[200," ","ml"]}]]}]],[],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Granulated Sugar",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[100," ","g"]}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Lemon Peel",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[1," ","pc"]}]]}],["$","li","2",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Orange Peel",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[1," ","pc"]}]]}],["$","li","3",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Coffee Beans",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[5," ","pc"]}]]}],["$","li","4",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Cinnamon Stick",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[1," ","pc"]}]]}]]]}]]}],["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","Lemon peel, orange peel, coffee beans (3-5), caramelized sugar around the rim (optional)"]}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Instructions"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-300","children":"$10"}]]}]]}],["$","p",null,{"className":"mt-8 text-gray-300","children":"$11"}]]}]}]
