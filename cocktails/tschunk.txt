11:T4f4,Tschunk is a simple highball cocktail that has gained considerable popularity, particularly within specific subcultures in Germany. It’s characterized by its straightforward combination of dark rum, most often Stroh Rum 80, and Club-Mate, a caffeinated soda known for its earthy and herbal flavor profile. The drink's simplicity and relatively high caffeine content have contributed to its appeal as a functional and social beverage. The exact origins of the drink are murky, but it is generally accepted that Tschunk evolved in alternative and hacker circles during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Its popularity quickly spread through word of mouth, and it is now a commonly ordered drink in various bars and clubs across Germany and increasingly known internationally. It is known for its simple preparation. The name Tschunk is evocative and unique, but its etymology is debated. Some believe it is a portmanteau of 'Tschunk' (related to a slurring sound or activity) and 'drunk,' reflecting its intoxicating nature and impact. Others suggest it simply sounds cool and has no particular meaning, in true internet fashion. Tschunk reflects a blend of counter-cultural influences and a pragmatic approach to creating a functional and easy-to-make beverage.7:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"Tschunk"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-6","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Flavor Notes"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap gap-2","children":[["$","$Lf","0",{"href":"/flavours/spicy","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Spicy"}],["$","$Lf","1",{"href":"/flavours/herbal","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Herbal"}],["$","$Lf","2",{"href":"/flavours/earthy","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Earthy"}],["$","$Lf","3",{"href":"/flavours/sweet","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Sweet"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-8","children":["$","$L10",null,{"flavorProfile":{"body":4,"booziness":5,"bubbles":true,"complexity":5,"sourness":2,"sweetness":6}}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":[["$","$Lf",null,{"href":"/ingredients/stroh-rum-80","className":"hover:text-blue-400 transition-colors","children":"Stroh Rum 80"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[40," ","ml"]}]]}]],[],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Club-Mate",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[200," ","ml"]}]]}]]]}]]}],["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","Lime wedge, for squeezing and placement on rim"]}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Instructions"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-300","children":"Fill a highball glass with ice cubes.
