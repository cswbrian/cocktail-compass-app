Its popularity surged after the release of the movie \"The Big Lebowski\" in 1998, where it became the signature drink of the character \"The Dude.\" The cocktail is simple to prepare and offers a rich, sweet, and coffee-flavored experience. Its smooth texture and moderate alcohol content make it a popular choice for casual sipping. The White Russian is often enjoyed as an after-dinner drink or a dessert cocktail. Its components are straightforward to source, contributing to its accessibility and widespread appeal. Variations exist, such as using flavored vodkas or different types of cream (e.g., half-and-half or milk) to alter the flavor profile. Some recipes call for a dusting of nutmeg or cocoa powder on top as an extra garnish. The drink's enduring popularity lies in its simplicity, comforting flavor, and the cultural association with the iconic film character."}]]}]}]
