e:T465,The Boulevardier is a classic cocktail that's essentially a Negroni with whiskey swapped in for gin. It's a spirit-forward drink that offers a delightful balance of bitter, sweet, and boozy flavors. Its origins can be traced back to the 1920s in Paris, and it was popularized by Erskine Gwynne, an American expatriate who founded a magazine called Boulevardier. The drink quickly gained recognition for its sophisticated yet simple profile, making it a favorite among cocktail enthusiasts. Its relatively straightforward preparation and the availability of its ingredients have contributed to its enduring popularity. The Boulevardier offers a richer and deeper flavor compared to the Negroni, making it a perfect choice for whiskey lovers. Its versatility also allows for variations using different types of whiskey or adjusting the proportions to suit individual preferences. It is an excellent cocktail for cooler evenings or when a more robust and complex drink is desired. The Boulevardier stands as a testament to the enduring appeal of well-balanced and thoughtfully crafted cocktails that have stood the test of time.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"Boulevardier"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-6","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Flavor Notes"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap gap-2","children":[["$","span","0",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Bitter"}],["$","span","1",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Herbal"}],["$","span","2",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Fruity"}],["$","span","3",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Woody"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Bourbon",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[30," ","ml"]}]]}]],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Campari",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[30," ","ml"]}]]}]],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Sweet Vermouth",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[30," ","ml"]}]]}]]]}]]}],["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","Orange peel twist (expressed and inserted)"]}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Instructions"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-300","children":"Combine all ingredients in a mixing glass filled with ice.
