f:T458,The Tom and Jerry is a warm, comforting cocktail perfect for cold weather. It's essentially a hot batter mixed with spirits and hot water or milk. The batter is typically made with eggs, sugar, spices (such as cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves), and sometimes butter or cream. The drink is traditionally served in a mug and garnished with grated nutmeg. Its origins are often attributed to Pierce Egan, a British sports writer, who created it in the 1820s. While Egan may have popularized it, similar hot egg-based drinks existed before. The Tom and Jerry gained immense popularity in the United States, particularly during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Pre-made Tom and Jerry batter mixes were even commercially available, simplifying the preparation process. While its popularity has waned somewhat in recent years, the Tom and Jerry remains a beloved holiday tradition for many families. Its warming spices and creamy texture evoke feelings of nostalgia and festive cheer. The preparation is somewhat involved compared to simpler cocktails, but the resulting drink is a truly special and memorable experience.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"Tom and Jerry"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-6","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Flavor Notes"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap gap-2","children":[["$","span","0",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Creamy"}],["$","span","1",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Spicy"}],["$","span","2",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Sweet"}],["$","span","3",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Vanilla"}],["$","span","4",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Nutty"}],["$","span","5",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Woody"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":[["$","$Le",null,{"href":"/ingredients/dark-rum","className":"hover:text-blue-400 transition-colors","children":"Dark Rum"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[30," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":[["$","$Le",null,{"href":"/ingredients/cognac","className":"hover:text-blue-400 transition-colors","children":"Cognac"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[15," ","ml"]}]]}]],[],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Egg",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[2," ","whole"]}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Sugar",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[20," ","g"]}]]}],["$","li","2",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Ground Cinnamon",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[0," ","pinch"]}]]}],["$","li","3",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Ground Nutmeg",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[0," ","pinch"]}]]}],["$","li","4",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Ground Cloves",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[0," ","pinch"]}]]}],["$","li","5",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Hot Milk",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[120," ","ml"]}]]}]]]}]]}],["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","Freshly grated nutmeg on top"]}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Instructions"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-300","children":"1.
