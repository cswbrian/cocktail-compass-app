e:T4fc,The Gin Sour is a classic cocktail that balances the botanical notes of gin with the tartness of lemon juice and the sweetness of sugar. The addition of egg white, while optional, creates a silky smooth texture and a frothy head, elevating the drink's overall experience. Its origins can be traced back to the early days of cocktail making, evolving from simple punches to more refined concoctions. The Gin Sour is part of the larger 'sour' family of cocktails, characterized by a base spirit, citrus, and sweetener. The Gin Sour gained popularity during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, appearing in numerous cocktail books and becoming a staple in bars worldwide. It's a versatile drink that can be tailored to individual preferences by adjusting the sweetness or sourness levels. The quality of the gin significantly impacts the final flavor profile; London Dry gins are a common choice, providing a clean and crisp base, while more contemporary gins with unique botanical blends can add a modern twist. The Gin Sour remains a beloved choice for both seasoned cocktail enthusiasts and newcomers, appreciated for its simplicity, balance, and refreshing qualities. Its enduring popularity is a testament to its timeless appeal and the versatility of its basic formula.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"Gin Sour"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-6","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Flavor Notes"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap gap-2","children":[["$","span","0",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Citrus"}],["$","span","1",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Herbal"}],["$","span","2",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Sour"}],["$","span","3",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Sweet"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Gin",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[60," ","ml"]}]]}]],[],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Lemon Juice",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[30," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Simple Syrup",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[22," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","2",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Egg White",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[15," ","ml"]}]]}]]]}]]}],["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","Lemon peel twist or a few drops of bitters on the egg white foam (if used).
