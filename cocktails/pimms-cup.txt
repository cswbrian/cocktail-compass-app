d:T51a,The Pimm's Cup is a quintessential British summer cocktail, celebrated for its refreshing and complex flavor profile. Invented by James Pimm in the 1840s, it was originally served as a digestive tonic in his oyster bars in London. Pimm's No. 1, the base of the drink, is a gin-based liqueur infused with herbs, spices, and citrus. The exact recipe remains a closely guarded secret, contributing to the drink's unique character. Over time, the Pimm's Cup evolved from a simple digestif to a social staple, particularly at garden parties, sporting events like Wimbledon, and summer gatherings. Its appeal lies in its versatility and ease of preparation; it's typically lengthened with lemonade or ginger ale and garnished with an array of fruits and vegetables, creating a visually appealing and palate-pleasing beverage. Each variation of the Pimm's Cup reflects the personal preferences and seasonal availability of ingredients, making it a truly adaptable and enjoyable drink. The combination of the herbal Pimm's, crisp cucumber, sweet fruits, and bubbly mixer creates a balanced and invigorating experience. Pimm's Cup is considered a low ABV drink that is easy to drink and enjoy for extended periods. Its widespread popularity has cemented its place as a beloved summer tradition in the UK and beyond.5:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-8","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"Pimm's Cup"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Pimm's No. 1",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[50," ","ml"]}]]}]],[],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Lemonade or Ginger Ale",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[150," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Cucumber",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[3," ","slices"]}]]}],["$","li","2",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Orange",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[2," ","slices"]}]]}],["$","li","3",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Strawberry",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[3," ","halves"]}]]}],["$","li","4",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Mint",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[5," ","leaves"]}]]}]]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-6","children":["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","Cucumber ribbons, orange slices, strawberry halves, mint sprigs.
