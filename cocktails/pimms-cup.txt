e:T4bb,The Pimm's Cup is a quintessential British summer cocktail, celebrated for its refreshing and complex flavor profile. Created in the 1840s by James Pimm at his oyster bar in London, Pimm's No. 1 was initially intended as a digestive aid. Over time, it evolved into a popular mixed drink, particularly enjoyed at social events like Wimbledon and garden parties. The exact recipe for Pimm's No. 1 remains a closely guarded secret, but it is known to be gin-based and infused with a blend of herbs, spices, and fruit extracts. A classic Pimm's Cup typically combines Pimm's No. 1 with lemonade (often carbonated), various fresh fruits (such as oranges, strawberries, and cucumber), and herbs like mint or borage. The drink's appeal lies in its balance of sweetness, bitterness, and herbal notes, making it both refreshing and sophisticated. There are many regional variations, including the addition of ginger ale or sparkling wine for extra fizz. Its enduring popularity is a testament to its versatility and its ability to evoke the spirit of British summertime. The Pimm's Cup has become more than just a drink; it's a cultural icon, synonymous with warm weather, leisurely afternoons, and convivial gatherings.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"Pimm's Cup"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-6","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Flavor Notes"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap gap-2","children":[["$","span","0",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Fruity"}],["$","span","1",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Citrus"}],["$","span","2",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Herbal"}],["$","span","3",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Spicy"}],["$","span","4",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Bitter"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Pimm's No. 1",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[50," ","ml"]}]]}]],[],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Lemonade",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[150," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Cucumber",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[2," ","slices"]}]]}],["$","li","2",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Orange",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[2," ","slices"]}]]}],["$","li","3",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Strawberry",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[2," ","halves"]}]]}],["$","li","4",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Mint",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[5," ","leaves"]}]]}]]]}]]}],["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","Cucumber ribbons, orange slices, strawberry halves, and a sprig of mint."]}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Instructions"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-300","children":"Fill a highball glass or jug with ice.
