d:T45d,The Espresso Martini, a modern classic, was created in 1983 by Dick Bradsell at Fred's Club in London. Legend has it that a famous model walked into the bar and asked for a drink that would 'wake me up and then f*** me up'. Bradsell, drawing inspiration from a coffee machine nearby, combined vodka, freshly brewed espresso, coffee liqueur, and sugar to create the now-iconic cocktail. The drink quickly gained popularity for its stimulating and indulgent qualities, becoming a staple in cocktail bars worldwide. Its appeal lies in the balance of caffeine, alcohol, and sweetness, providing an energetic yet sophisticated experience. The Espresso Martini is typically served in a chilled coupe or martini glass, garnished with coffee beans for an elegant presentation. Variations include the addition of flavored vodkas, different types of coffee liqueurs, or even a splash of cream for added richness. Despite its relatively recent origins, the Espresso Martini has cemented its place in cocktail history, demonstrating the enduring appeal of coffee-based cocktails and the power of a well-crafted, innovative drink.5:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-8","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"Espresso Martini"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Vodka",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[50," ","ml"]}]]}]],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Coffee Liqueur",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[20," ","ml"]}]]}]],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Freshly Brewed Espresso",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[30," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Simple Syrup",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[5," ","ml"]}]]}]]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-6","children":["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","Three coffee beans, floated on top in a symmetrical pattern.
