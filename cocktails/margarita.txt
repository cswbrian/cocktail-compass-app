d:T57d,The Margarita is arguably one of the most popular and recognizable cocktails in the world. Its simple yet harmonious blend of tequila, lime juice, and orange liqueur has made it a staple at bars and restaurants globally. While the exact origin of the Margarita is debated, several stories circulate, each claiming to have invented this classic drink. One popular theory attributes its creation to Margarita Sames, a socialite who allegedly concocted the drink for her guests in Acapulco, Mexico, in 1948. Another version suggests that the Margarita was invented in 1938 by Carlos "Danny" Herrera at his restaurant Rancho La Gloria, near Tijuana, to satisfy a showgirl who was allergic to all hard liquor except tequila, but she didn't like to take tequila straight. Regardless of its true origin, the Margarita's enduring appeal lies in its balance of flavors. The tequila provides the base, offering a distinct agave taste, while the lime juice adds a refreshing tartness. The orange liqueur introduces a touch of sweetness and complexity, tying all the elements together. The Margarita is traditionally served in a salt-rimmed glass, which enhances the drink's flavors by contrasting the sweet and sour notes. The cocktail can be enjoyed in various forms, including on the rocks (served over ice) or blended into a frozen concoction, making it a versatile choice for different occasions and preferences.5:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-8","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"Margarita"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Tequila",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[50," ","ml"]}]]}]],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Orange Liqueur",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[25," ","ml"]}]]}]],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Lime Juice",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[25," ","ml"]}]]}]]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-6","children":["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","Lime wedge, salt rim (optional).
