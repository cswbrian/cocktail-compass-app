e:T446,The Sherry Cobbler is a classic cocktail with a rich history, dating back to the early 19th century. It gained immense popularity in the United States during the 1830s and 1840s, becoming a ubiquitous drink in bars and homes alike. Its appeal stemmed from its refreshing nature, ease of preparation, and the versatility offered by using different types of sherry. Often served in a tall glass filled with shaved ice and adorned with an array of fresh fruit, the Sherry Cobbler was as much a visual delight as it was a flavorful one. It was one of the first mixed drinks to be enjoyed through a straw. Historical accounts suggest that the Sherry Cobbler was a favorite of prominent figures, further cementing its status as a sophisticated and fashionable beverage. Over time, the Sherry Cobbler's popularity waned, but it has experienced a resurgence in recent years as bartenders and cocktail enthusiasts rediscover classic recipes and appreciate the drink's unique qualities. Its enduring appeal lies in its simplicity, elegance, and the delightful combination of sherry, sweetness, and fruit.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"Sherry Cobbler"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-6","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Flavor Notes"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap gap-2","children":[["$","span","0",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Fruity"}],["$","span","1",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Citrus"}],["$","span","2",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Nutty"}],["$","span","3",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Woody"}],["$","span","4",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Floral"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Oloroso Sherry",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[90," ","ml"]}]]}]],[],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Sugar",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[2," ","tsp"]}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Water",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[3," ","ml"]}]]}]]]}]]}],["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","Assorted fresh fruit (berries, orange slices, lemon slices), mint sprig, powdered sugar dusting"]}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Instructions"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-300","children":"In a shaker, muddle sugar with water until sugar is dissolved.
