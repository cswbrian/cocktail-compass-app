d:T545,The Mint Julep is a classic cocktail deeply rooted in American history, particularly associated with the Kentucky Derby. Its origins can be traced back to the early 18th century, where it was initially consumed as a medicinal drink. The word "julep" itself comes from the Persian word "gulab," meaning rosewater, which hints at the drink's aromatic past. Over time, the julep evolved from a medicinal concoction to a refreshing beverage enjoyed by the Southern elite. It gained significant popularity in the 19th century, becoming a symbol of Southern hospitality and refinement. The modern Mint Julep, featuring bourbon, mint, sugar, and crushed ice, became synonymous with the Kentucky Derby in 1938. Every year, Churchill Downs serves nearly 120,000 juleps during the Kentucky Derby weekend, solidifying its status as the Derby's signature drink. The drink represents a combination of simplicity and elegance, where the quality of ingredients and proper technique are paramount. The choice of bourbon is crucial, as it provides the backbone of the drink's flavor profile, while fresh mint infuses a refreshing herbal note. Crushed ice is essential for creating a frosty, thirst-quenching texture. A well-made Mint Julep should be a balanced blend of sweet, minty, and boozy flavors, served in a frosted silver or pewter cup to maintain its chill.5:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-8","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"Mint Julep"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Bourbon Whiskey",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[60," ","ml"]}]]}]],[],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Fresh Mint Leaves",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[10," ","leaves"]}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Simple Syrup",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[10," ","ml"]}]]}]]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-6","children":["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","A generous sprig of fresh mint, lightly slapped to release its aroma.
