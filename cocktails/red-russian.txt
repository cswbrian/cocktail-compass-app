e:T43d,The Red Russian is a simple yet potent cocktail composed of vodka and coffee liqueur. Its origins are somewhat debated, but it gained popularity in the mid-20th century. It is essentially a variation of the Black Russian, with the addition of cream, or milk, or left as is (clear). The drink is known for its strong flavor and relatively high alcohol content, deriving solely from the vodka and coffee liqueur. Its preparation is straightforward, making it a popular choice for both home bartenders and professional mixologists. The Red Russian offers a rich, coffee-forward flavor with a smooth, creamy texture and a significant kick, making it a favorite among those who appreciate strong, uncomplicated cocktails. The drink is typically served on the rocks, which helps to dilute the alcohol and chill the beverage, further enhancing its appeal. Over time, numerous variations of the Red Russian have emerged, each offering a unique twist on the classic recipe. However, the core combination of vodka and coffee liqueur remains the defining characteristic of this enduring cocktail.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"Red Russian"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-6","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Flavor Notes"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap gap-2","children":[["$","span","0",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Coffee"}],["$","span","1",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Sweet"}],["$","span","2",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Creamy"}],["$","span","3",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Chocolate"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Vodka",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[50," ","ml"]}]]}]],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Coffee Liqueur",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[25," ","ml"]}]]}]],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Heavy Cream",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[25," ","ml"]}]]}]]]}]]}],["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","None typically, but a coffee bean or dusting of cocoa powder are acceptable."]}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Instructions"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-300","children":"Fill an old-fashioned glass with ice.
