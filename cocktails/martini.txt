d:T474,The Martini is arguably the most iconic cocktail of all time. Its origins are murky, with several competing stories. One popular theory suggests it evolved from the Martinez, a cocktail served in the late 19th century in Martinez, California, during the Gold Rush. Another account credits a bartender at the Knickerbocker Hotel in New York City in the early 1900s. Regardless of its exact origin, the Martini gained prominence in the early 20th century and has since become a symbol of sophistication and elegance. The classic recipe involves gin and dry vermouth, stirred (or shaken, as famously preferred by James Bond) with ice and strained into a chilled glass. Garnished with an olive or a lemon twist, the Martini offers a crisp, dry flavor that can be tailored to individual preferences by adjusting the ratio of gin to vermouth. Over the years, the Martini has undergone countless variations, but the classic version remains a testament to simplicity and balance in cocktail making. Its enduring appeal lies in its versatility and the subtle nuances that can be achieved through variations in ingredients and preparation techniques.5:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-8","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"Martini"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Gin",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[60," ","ml"]}]]}]],[],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Dry Vermouth",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[10," ","ml"]}]]}]]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-6","children":["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","Olive (Spanish or Castelvetrano) or Lemon twist, expressed"]}]}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Instructions"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-300","children":"Chill a Martini glass.
