Created in the 1930s by Donn Beach (Don the Beachcomber) at his Hollywood restaurant, it quickly gained popularity due to its exotic flavors and high alcohol content. The original recipe was a closely guarded secret, with only Donn Beach and his bartenders knowing the exact proportions. The name 'Zombie' came from the drink's reputation for leaving patrons feeling like the walking dead the next day. Its popularity surged after it was featured at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Over the years, many variations have emerged, but the core concept of blending different rums remains central. The Zombie is a classic example of Tiki culture, representing a blend of escapism, tropical flavors, and potent libations. Modern versions often balance the original's intensity with more approachable sweetness and acidity, but the drink remains a powerful and flavorful experience."}]]}]}]
