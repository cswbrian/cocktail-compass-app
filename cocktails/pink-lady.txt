11:T4c8,The Pink Lady is a classic gin-based cocktail known for its appealing pink hue and balanced flavor profile. Its history is somewhat debated, with possible origins in the early 20th century. One popular theory suggests that the cocktail was named after the musical 'The Pink Lady' that premiered in 1911. Another claims it was named after actress and singer Hazel Dawn, who starred in the musical. Initially, the Pink Lady was often viewed as a 'ladies' drink' due to its sweetness and color, which led to some bartenders disdaining its creation. The inclusion of egg white gives the cocktail a silky texture, while grenadine provides both the signature pink color and a touch of sweetness. Applejack adds a fruity complexity that complements the gin. However, applejack can be hard to find, so Calvados or even apple brandy is an acceptable substitution. The lemon juice balances the sweetness with acidity, resulting in a harmonious and refreshing drink. Over time, the Pink Lady has experienced fluctuations in popularity, but it remains a notable classic cocktail with a distinctive appearance and flavor. Its recipe has also been adapted over the years, with some versions including different sweeteners or fruit juices.7:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"Pink Lady"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-6","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Flavor Notes"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap gap-2","children":[["$","$Lf","0",{"href":"/flavours/fruity","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Fruity"}],["$","$Lf","1",{"href":"/flavours/citrus","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Citrus"}],["$","$Lf","2",{"href":"/flavours/floral","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Floral"}],["$","$Lf","3",{"href":"/flavours/creamy","className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors","children":"Creamy"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-8","children":["$","$L10",null,{"flavorProfile":{"body":5,"booziness":4,"bubbles":false,"complexity":6,"sourness":6,"sweetness":5}}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":[["$","$Lf",null,{"href":"/ingredients/gin","className":"hover:text-blue-400 transition-colors","children":"Gin"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[45," ","ml"]}]]}]],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Grenadine",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[15," ","ml"]}]]}]],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Lemon Juice",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[15," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Applejack",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[30," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","2",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Egg White",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[1," ","pc"]}]]}]]]}]]}],["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","Brandied cherry"]}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Instructions"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-300","children":"Combine all ingredients in a cocktail shaker without ice.
