d:T49d,The French 75 is a classic cocktail that combines gin, lemon juice, sugar, and Champagne. Its origin can be traced back to World War I, with early versions appearing at Harry's New York Bar in Paris. The drink was named after the French 75mm field gun, a weapon known for its speed and accuracy, reflecting the cocktail's potent and impactful nature. Initially, the drink was simpler, sometimes using Calvados or brandy instead of gin. The combination of gin and Champagne creates a sparkling and effervescent experience, while the lemon and sugar balance the flavors, offering a crisp and refreshing taste. The French 75 gained widespread popularity during the 1920s, becoming a symbol of celebration and sophistication. Over the years, variations have emerged, but the classic recipe remains a testament to the cocktail's enduring appeal, offering a perfect blend of strength, elegance, and historical significance. It's a drink for toasting special moments, embodying a sense of joie de vivre with every sip. The balance of the cocktail is key, ensuring that no single element overpowers the others, creating a harmonious and delightful beverage that has stood the test of time.5:["$","div",null,{"className":"p-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl mb-6","children":"French 75"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-6","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Flavor Notes"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap gap-2","children":[["$","span","0",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Citrus"}],["$","span","1",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Floral"}],["$","span","2",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Fruity"}],["$","span","3",{"className":"bg-gray-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm","children":"Yeasty"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-2","children":"Ingredients"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"space-y-2","children":[[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Gin",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[30," ","ml"]}]]}]],[],[["$","li","0",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Lemon Juice",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[15," ","ml"]}]]}],["$","li","1",{"className":"flex justify-between","children":["Simple Syrup",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":[7," ","ml"]}]]}]]]}]]}],["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-gray-400","children":["Garnish: ","Lemon twist, expressed and placed in the glass"]}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"font-bold mb-4","children":"Instructions"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-300","children":"Combine gin, lemon juice, and simple syrup in a cocktail shaker with ice.
